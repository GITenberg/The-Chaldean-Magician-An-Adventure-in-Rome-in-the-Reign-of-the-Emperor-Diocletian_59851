<h2 class="no-break">CHAPTER I.</h2>


<p>A cloudless October day, A. D. 299,
was drawing to a close; the western sky
behind the crest of Mt. Janiculum still
glowed with crimson light, but the population
in the streets and squares of the world’s
capital were already moving in a bluish
twilight and yellow-red lamps shone, veiled
by smoke, from the taverns of the many-gabled
Subura.</p>

<p>A youth with a white toga thrown over
his shoulders, coming from the Querquetulanian
Gate, turned into the Cyprian Way.
His manner of walking was somewhat peculiar.
Sometimes he rushed hastily forward,<span class="pagenum">[2]</span>
like a man impatiently striving to
reach his destination; at others he glanced
hesitatingly around or stopped a few seconds
as though repenting his design. Passing
the Baths of Titus he perceived, only a
few yards distant, another youth who had
entered the Cyprian Way from a side street
on the left and with bowed head was pursuing
the same direction over the lava
stones of the pavement. Looking more
closely, he recognized a friend’s countenance
in the new-comer’s pallid features.</p>

<p>It was nearly six weeks since he had
seen pleasant Lucius Rutilius; for the two
young men’s paths in life were entirely different.
While Rutilius, the son of a wealthy
senator, was fond of moving in the most select
circles of the capital, visiting the theatres,
the races and combats in the arena,
and during the summer spending his time
alternately at his country estate in Etruria,
the waterfalls of Tibur, the shore of the<span class="pagenum">[3]</span>
gulf of Baiae, or the strand of Antium,
Caius Bononius, the son of a knight, led a
somewhat secluded existence in the solitude
of his study, allowing himself at the utmost
a short trip during the hottest months to
the world-renowned Diana’s Mirror, the
lovely secluded lake in the neighboring Alban
Hills, where he owned a modest little
garden. Spite of this diversity in external
circumstances, the two young men cherished
a deeply-rooted friendship for each other.
Lucius Rutilius valued the comprehensive
knowledge, insatiable thirst for information,
and proud independence possessed by Caius
Bononius; while the latter knew that Rutilius
beheld the splendor of life in the great
capital, not with the eyes of the coarse man
of pleasure, but with those of the poet; that
he revelled in the pomp of color, the luxury of
eternal Rome, as the creative artist rejoiced
in the effects of light and shade in a landscape;
that amid this seething whirlpool<span class="pagenum">[4]</span>
he had preserved a warm heart, a noble
unselfishness of nature.</p>

<p>At Caius’ call Lucius Rutilius raised
his head, covered with black, curling locks,
as though startled from a deep reverie. A
crimson flush, visible even in the gathering
twilight, mounted to his brow, as if the
other had caught him in forbidden paths.</p>

<p>“Is it you, Bononius?” he stammered.
“Are you, too, to be met in the crowd of
pedestrians? True, it’s lonely enough here
in the aristocratic Cyprian Way to allow
you to indulge your taste for seclusion even
while walking.”</p>

<p>“I have really avoided all society during
the last few weeks,” replied Caius Bononius,
“strange problems have engrossed my attention.
But you&mdash;what brings you, without
any companion, to this quarter of silence
at this hour of the day? You used at this
time to be reclining at table&mdash;with roses
from Paestum in your hair and your glowing<span class="pagenum">[5]</span>
lips pressed to an exquisitely-polished murrhine
cup, if not on the neck of some radiant
young beauty.”</p>

<p>Lucius blushed again.</p>

<p>“Things are different now,” he replied
with his eyes bent on the ground.</p>

<p>“How?” asked Caius Bononius in surprise.
“Has my Lucius renounced the delights
of the revel and the lustre of flower-wreathed
triclinia?”</p>

<p>“Not entirely&mdash;but your remark about
a young beauty&mdash;you needn’t smile, Caius!
In perfect truth: during the last month a
change has taken place in this respect,
which&mdash;how am I to say...?”</p>

<p>“How are you to speak? As you
think! The confusion in your words distinctly
shows how hard you are trying to
conceal rather than disclose your thoughts.
Come, Lucius! Have you so completely
forgotten that we did not vow faith and<span class="pagenum">[6]</span>
friendship to each other only over the
golden Falernian, that our relations have a
deeper root? If things have occurred that
influence your character, your views of the
world, let me know what has affected you;
for as a sincere, though half-superfluous
friend, I have a right to your implicit confidence.
As I live, you give me the impression
that some important matter is in
question. Speak, my Lucius! Have you,
in contradiction to your whole past, thrown
yourself into the study of philosophy?
Have you come in contact with some saint
of the sect of the Nazarenes and thus acquired
a taste for the beautiful legends of
the East?”</p>

<p>“Nothing of the sort,” sighed Lucius,
taking his friend by the arm and drawing
him slowly along with him in the direction
of the Subura. “You will laugh at me when
you learn how your invincible Epicurean
has fared at last.... Yes, you are right,<span class="pagenum">[7]</span>
Caius; it would be foolish if I wished to
conceal from you, my faithful friend, what
your penetration would nevertheless discover.... So
know&mdash;but don’t accuse me
of weakness&mdash;I am desperately in love, not
only with my eyes, as before, but body and
soul, a second Troilus, a Leander who
would breast the surges of every sea to at
last clasp his Hero in his arms.”</p>

<p>“You have often talked so,” said Caius
smiling.</p>

<p>“Talked, but never felt. The best
proof of the genuineness of my emotions&mdash;to
myself&mdash;is the ardor with which I long
to lead the beloved maiden across my threshold
as my wife. You know ‘marriage’
used to be a terrible word to me, Caius:
now, since I have seen Hero&mdash;her name is
really Hero, and she is the daughter of an
aristocratic Sicilian&mdash;since that time I have
known nothing sweeter than Hymen’s torch,
and longingly await the moment which,<span class="pagenum">[8]</span>
spite of all difficulties and disasters, must at
last unite us.”</p>

<p>“Difficulties?” repeated Bononius, pausing.
“Does Hero deny her Leander the
ardently-desired love? Has the handsome
Rutilius for the first time wooed in vain?”</p>

<p>Lucius Rutilius gazed at the western
sky as if he were examining the position of
the stars.</p>

<p>“There is still time,” he murmured, then
turning to Bononius, added:</p>

<p>“Wooed in vain? No&mdash;yet it is almost
the same thing. Does this contradiction
seem to you an enigma? If you wish,
you shall learn all&mdash;only not here, where
the passers-by are growing more numerous
and a listener might misuse my words. I
have business on the northern slope of the
Quirinal in about an hour&mdash;until then let
us stay in my uncle Publius Calpurnius’
house, here on the right of the Patrician
Way. He is Caius Decius’ guest to-day:<span class="pagenum">[9]</span>
we can walk up and down the portico undisturbed&mdash;and
to be frank, I long to pour
out my heart to you, receive your counsel.”</p>

<p>Bononius hesitated. He seemed to be
secretly making a hasty calculation.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said at last, “if it won’t
occupy too much time.... You won’t take
it amiss, if I tell you that I, too, in an hour
at latest....”</p>

<p>“Oh&mdash;I can explain everything in ten
minutes.”</p>

<p>Turning to the right, he drew his friend
along with him, and a short time after they
knocked at the door of a spacious mansion.
The porter drew back the bolt, bowed, and
ushered the two youths through the passage
into the atrium.</p>

<p>The residence of Publius Calpurnius
was one of the huge, luxurious edifices,
which seemed to vie in extent with the immense
palaces erected by the emperor Diocletian<span class="pagenum">[10]</span>
in Salona and Nicomedia. Of no
unusual external magnificence and with a
moderate façade, it developed directly behind
the atrium the most surprising size,
stretching on the right and left over the
ground naturally belonging to the neighboring
houses and spreading towards the
slope of the hill. Caius Bononius, who
almost intentionally avoided the homes
of Roman grandees, often as Lucius&mdash;at
least in former days&mdash;had endeavored
to draw his friend into the life and bustle
of the capital, scanned with surprise and
curiosity the magnificently-decorated structure,
the halls of the two court-yards
where a dozen gaily-clad slaves were
just lighting the candelabra, the brilliant-hued
paintings on the walls, the portrait-statues&mdash;men
in somewhat un-Roman
sleeved garments, and women with extremely
realistic styles of hair-dressing
which looked as if the latest coiffure of a<span class="pagenum">[11]</span>
fashionable visitor to the circus had served
the sculptor for a model.</p>

<p>In fact, Lucius asserted that these styles
of arranging the hair were removable, and
could be taken from the statues’ heads and
exchanged for modern ones as fashion required&mdash;a
triumph of the plastic art, as he
ironically added.</p>

<p>So they walked through the second pillared
court-yard to the garden. The dusky
avenues of trees, whose spreading boughs
still permitted enough of the fading daylight
to enter to reveal the box-bordered gravelled
paths, invited thoughtful, pleasant strolls,
and the watchman at the back of the house
afforded a sufficient guarantee that no intruder
would steal after the youths.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>


<p>“At the end of last month,” Lucius
Rutilius began, “Hero had firmly resolved
to unite her life with mine. I made her acquaintance
at Tibur, where her father had
purchased Junius’ Gellius’ villa&mdash;it adjoins
my own, you know&mdash;after the death of its
first owner. Wandering through the park, I
saw the bewitching girlish figure on the opposite
side of the wall that divides Gellius’
grounds from mine. Hero was standing in
the shade of a laurel-bush, her fair hair
adorned simply with a rose, scattering with
her dainty little hands crumbs or corn,
which she held gathered in her robe, to a
fluttering cloud of sparrows. Concealed
behind the pedestal of a goddess of autumn,
I could watch her quietly without having
my presence suspected.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[13]</span></p>

<p>“Ah, my dear Caius, I should vainly try
to describe the subtle charm, childlike innocence,
and enchanting grace revealed to me
in that quarter of an hour! How she
chatted with her protégés, repelled the bold
and encouraged the timid ones, how she
jested and laughed, how her loose tunic
slipped from her snowy shoulder&mdash;it was
bewitching! In short, those fifteen minutes
decided my fate. For the first time during
a life of twenty-six years I experienced at
the sight of a girl who charmed me a feeling
of sacred reserve, a sort of reverence
that made any wanton thought seem a
crime. In my ardent dreams, which instantly
twined with eager longing around
this lovely apparition, I saw her only as the
presiding mistress of my house, the ruler of
my life....”</p>

<p>“It really appears to be a serious
matter,” murmured Caius Bononius. “Does
the night-breeze rustling through the boughs<span class="pagenum">[14]</span>
deceive me, or what is it that makes your
voice tremble so?”</p>

<p>“Do not doubt!” replied Rutilius.
“What I feel for Hero is sacred enough to
fill my heart with the emotions that seize
devout worshippers at the presence of the
goddess. Now hear the rest. Wholly absorbed
by one thought, I returned to the
house and pondered in solitude over the
problem how I might succeed in reaching
the desired goal. Usually&mdash;as you know&mdash;I
was not embarrassed when in the society
of beautiful girls and women; but here the
often-tested art of crafty plans seemed to
leave me in the lurch. After twenty absurdly
tasteless ideas I resolved to ask Agathon&mdash;who
also lived at Tibur&mdash;to take
me with him as an uninvited guest to the
next banquet given by her father, Heliodorus.
A pretended desire to talk with him
about the sale of a small grove would serve
for an excuse. Agathon cast a strange<span class="pagenum">[15]</span>
glance at me when I informed him of my
wish. Perhaps this sort of introduction was
not the best, though I thought it so; for
you, too, will some day learn, spite of all
the wisdom that now fills your soul, that love
makes even the most experienced people
unskilful.”</p>

<p>“On the contrary,” replied Bononius,
“I believe great passions render us inventive.”</p>

<p>“We won’t argue the point. Inventive
perhaps in what is decisive, but foolish in
every other respect.&mdash;Agathon consented,
and on the third day the opportunity offered.
Heliodorus received me with the manners
of a polished man of the world, greeting me
as a neighbor whose acquaintance he had
long desired to make. As to the grove,
about which I incoherently stammered a
few words, he would consider the matter,
and if he could really oblige me, would
willingly make a sacrifice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[16]</span></p>

<p>“The banquet passed without my even
obtaining a glimpse of the object of my ardent
longing; yet I might well be satisfied.
From this hour the wall between our two
estates was as it were demolished; an intercourse
began, which after a short time
developed into friendly relations, and now
of course Hero, who had retired from the
sight of the guests at the noisy drinking-bout,
was visible at any hour of the day to
the neighbor who came as it were clad in a
tunic,<a id="FNanchor_1_1" href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> to see her father.</p>

<p>“Let me say nothing about how it all
happened. A hundred details gradually
wove the certainty that the worthy Sicilian’s
daughter favored me, and one evening in
the park, on the very spot under the laurel-bush
where I had first beheld her, I kissed
the words of consent from her quivering
lips.</p>

<p>“Those were happy days, Bononius!<span class="pagenum">[17]</span>
We still kept our love concealed; not that
we had reason to doubt her father’s consent,
but there was an indescribable charm
in this mystery; I might say: we feared to
profane our happiness, if we should draw
aside the veil too soon. True, our relations
did not wholly escape the excellent Heliodorus’
notice. More than once, while wandering
by Hero’s side through the colonnades
of the peristyle, I met his sympathizing
smile, which seemed to say: ‘Friend,
I see through you, but am not angered by
your secret suit.’</p>

<p>“Then one evening&mdash;we had formed
the resolution the day before to appear on
the following Friday, October 1st, Heliodorus’
birthday, hand in hand before him and
reveal everything&mdash;Hero received me with
an agitated expression that greatly alarmed
me. Her father had gone to Rome on
business and was not expected to return till
late. Hero had been alone all day with<span class="pagenum">[18]</span>
Lydia, a young relative with whom she was
educated, had refused old Septimia, her
grey-haired confidante, admission to her
apartments, neglected to eat, and did not
dress until the hour I usually came, when
she waited for me on the stone bench under
the colonnade of the peristyle. Lydia&mdash;a
charming creature, by the way, only she reminds
one a little too much of our highly-painted
fashionable ladies to compare with
Hero’s divine simplicity&mdash;was sitting beside
her when I entered. My sweet, sorrowful
love was holding a triangular paper
in her hand; Lydia, frowning, clenched in
her dainty fist a parchment covered with red
letters. After long questioning I learned
the following details.</p>

<p>“The two girls were walking in the
grounds just after sunrise, as they usually
did in the morning. Suddenly a hideously-ugly
old woman, dressed in rags, stood before
the unsuspecting maidens, called three<span class="pagenum">[19]</span>
times in a shrill voice, with the expression
of a Gorgon, a prophetic ‘woe!’, threw a
roll at my trembling Hero’s feet, and hastily
vanished.</p>

<p>“The girls, as if spellbound by this mysterious
apparition, took the roll from the
ground and untied its fastenings. The
contents consisted of a written parchment
and a triangular piece of blank paper.
The purport of the parchment was as follows:</p>

<p>“‘Olbasanus the Chaldean, the investigator
of the future and warner of blinded
humanity, writes this to Hero, the daughter
of Heliodorus. The gods have announced
to us that, inflamed with love for Lucius
Rutilius, you cherish the design of accepting
him for a husband. Olbasanus warns
you against this intention, for his eye has
read in the stars what horrible misfortunes
threaten you and yours, especially Lucius
Rutilius himself, if you carry out your resolve.<span class="pagenum">[20]</span>
As you might not believe my warning,
I send you with this letter a sacred leaf
from the book of the god Amun. Carry the
page to the hearth, lay it on the stone flags,
but so that the flames cannot reach it; bow
thrice with clasped hands and await the divine
revelation. Amun himself, with invisible
finger, will write upon this page
from his book and announce what is impending
if you despise his sacred will.’</p>

<p>“This was the purport of the parchment
Lydia convulsively clenched in her
fingers.”</p>

<p>During the last few moments Caius Bononius
had pressed his friend’s arm more
closely and showed other tokens of increasing
interest.</p>

<p>“Olbasanus?” he now asked, as Lucius
Rutilius paused a moment to take breath.
“The Chaldean on the Quirinal?”</p>

<p>“The same. His name had already
reached my ears, but I now learned for the<span class="pagenum">[21]</span>
first time his ghost-like influence and his
power.”</p>

<p>“Go on! go on!” urged Bononius.</p>

<p>“Well,” continued the other, “this
paper had been enough to throw the two
girls into the utmost excitement. Lydia&mdash;an
exception to her sex&mdash;had hitherto
made no attempt to pry into her friend’s
secret, although she, too, had long since
perceived our relations. Now, when the
affair was so suddenly and unexpectedly revealed,
she forgot the usual questions,
amazement, congratulations. In her heartfelt
anxiety she pressed into the rooms occupied
by the head cook, impetuously sent away
all the slaves, and told her friend to do
what Olbasanus had directed. Hero, almost
bereft of her senses, bowed thrice over
the mysterious page and, after a few
seconds, perceived with mysterious horror
the black characters that were to announce
what barred her happiness. She read: ‘To<span class="pagenum">[22]</span>
the father, madness, to the daughter, blindness,
to Lucius Rutilius, death.’”</p>

<p>“Unprecedented!” cried Caius Bononius.
“And a strange coincidence!”</p>

<p>“What do you mean by that?” asked
Rutilius.</p>

<p>“Afterwards, my dear fellow! Let me
first hear the end of your adventure! True,
I scarcely need an explanation of the result
of the affair. What reply did you make
when the young girls had shown you the
page from the book of Amun?”</p>

<p>“I tried to doubt&mdash;but the spectral
letters and my sorrowful Hero’s troubled
eyes spoke only too distinctly. The fact
that this was some strange marvel, an inexplicable
miracle, apparently sent by the
gods themselves&mdash;never wavered. At first
I was painfully moved, but in the course of
our conversation, as Hero seemed to grow
calmer, I regained a certain degree of confidence,
and when in the middle of the first<span class="pagenum">[23]</span>
vigil<a id="FNanchor_2_2" href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> I entered my house, was disposed,
spite of the still unsolved enigma, to regard
the whole matter rather as a strange adventure
than a misfortune.</p>

<p>“The next day was to undeceive me bitterly.
Going into the street at the time of
the second breakfast, I saw two large travelling-carriages
before the door of the next
house. As I was about to ask one of the
slaves who held the horses the object of
these preparations, Heliodorus and the two
young girls crossed the threshold. The
Sicilian greeted me and said that he was on
his way, with Hero and Lydia, to bid me
farewell. Hero, who, as I knew, was a
little tyrant, had suddenly declared that she
detested Tibur from the very bottom of her
soul and longed to go back to Rome, so as
it was now so late in the season that he,
Heliodorus, had no real reason for opposing<span class="pagenum">[24]</span>
this wish, he had decided with his usual
promptness.</p>

<p>“Of course I knew that Hero’s suddenly
awakened longing was connected with Olbasanus.
She wanted to seek him, learn
farther particulars about the strange prophecy,
and if possible appease by prayers and
sacrifices the hostile powers that opposed
our happiness.</p>

<p>“Ere fifteen minutes had passed the
whole party, including old Septimia and
some of the household slaves, were seated
among the cushions, and preceded by three
horsemen, rolling along the road to Rome.</p>

<p>“You will not be surprised, dear Bononius,
when I tell you that I, too, left
Tibur that very day and returned to the
seven-hilled city. With a heavy heart I
approached the next morning the superb
Hellenic dwelling on the northern side of
the Caelian Hill, occupied by Heliodorus.
The Sicilian received me cordially and<span class="pagenum">[25]</span>
kindly, though with a somewhat anxious
air. Seating myself by his side, I learned
that Hero seemed to be ill. Shortly after
her arrival she had entered her litter, accompanied
by Lydia, returning at a late
hour with every sign of agitation. Since
then she had lain dejectedly on her couch,
scarcely answering a question, but gazing
fixedly, with a pallid face, into vacancy.
Once she had burst into violent sobs, her
whole frame shaken by emotion; then increased
depression and exhaustion followed
until at last, long after midnight, she fell
asleep.</p>

<p>“Of course I guessed what had happened.
Hero had been to Olbasanus and
had heard from the soothsayer’s lips the
same thing the inscription had predicted.
Nay, it seemed as if the manner of this confirmation
had been far more terrible and demoniac
than the first warning by the page
from the book of the god Amun. I was<span class="pagenum">[26]</span>
utterly at a loss and, stammering my regret
in incoherent words, left the house, begging
the Sicilian to inform me when his daughter’s
health was so far restored that I might
repeat my visit without being intrusive.</p>

<p>“On the next evening,” continued Rutilius,&mdash;“it
was the very Friday we had
chosen for the disclosure of our secret, but
in my excitement I had entirely forgotten
Heliodorus’ birthday&mdash;I received a few
lines from Hero that almost drove me to
despair.</p>

<p>“‘We must part,’ she wrote, ‘part forever.
I had hoped the cruel warning that
terrified me at Tibur was only the expression
of some hidden resentment which
might be appeased. But now I know that
the gods themselves bar our way with their
destroying curse. I have visited Olbasanus
twice: day before yesterday at the dinner
hour and yesterday at the commencement
of the first vigil. This man&mdash;do not doubt<span class="pagenum">[27]</span>
it&mdash;holds intercourse with the gods, demons,
and the dead; he has been given
power over all the realms of spirits! I have
heard it with these ears, seen it with these
eyes! When, after manifold proofs of his
omnipotence, I still doubted&mdash;alas, only
because I shrank from despair&mdash;at a sign
from the terrible man the goddess of death,
Hecate herself, appeared to me in the
clouds of the night heavens, and in a voice
like the roaring of the storm, repeated the
awful words I had read on the page of
Amun. We must part, Lucius, not for my
sake&mdash;oh! how gladly would I bear the
curse of blindness, if I might win in you a
higher, purer light&mdash;but for yours, to whom
cruel Hecate predicts death, and for love of
my dear father, whose mind is threatened
with darkness. Farewell, dear Lucius!
May you learn to forget more easily than
I!’</p>

<p>“These were the words engraved upon<span class="pagenum">[28]</span>
my heart in indelible, torturing characters,
as if written by a red-hot stylus. I now
learned from my slave Gaipor, that Olbasanus
was really considered by thousands
of people the most powerful conjurer among
all the Chaldeans of the seven-hilled city.
Gaipor himself, before I bought him, had
been sent to the magician by his mistress,
a lady from Neapolis, to enquire about the
future, and had beheld with his own eyes,
like Hero, the terrible apparition of Hecate,
who, surrounded by flames, soared across
the starry sky. You know, Caius, I am
not very credulous. I’ve often laughed at
our augurs<a id="FNanchor_3_3" href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and soothsayers, and paid the
homage of my sincere respect to that general
in the time of the Republic, who when
the sacred chickens would not eat, flung
them into the sea. But here conviction
pressed upon me with such power that I
succumbed to its force....”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum">[29]</span></p>
<p>“Hecate!” murmured Caius Bononius.
“This marvel was attested to me also, not
by one or two persons who had beheld it,
but by twenty. Know, Rutilius, that for
months I have been reckoning what this
Olbasanus accomplishes by means of his
league with gods and demons.... But you
had not finished your story. Go on, Lucius;
but make haste!”</p>

<p>“I have finished,” replied the youth.
“There’s only one thing more to add.
Amid the dull, heart-corroding grief that
mastered me, the desire to visit in the hall
of his incantations, the man who had destroyed
my future&mdash;though with kind intentions&mdash;daily
became more uncontrollable.
I, too, wished to ask the terrible
queen of the underworld a question.
Every effort to see my beloved Hero again
was unavailing. Heliodorus, too, seemed
completely transformed&mdash;his frank bearing
had become so timid and constrained. The<span class="pagenum">[30]</span>
impossibility of speaking to Hero, or even
Lydia, drove me to carry my desire into
execution. Nay, I conquered my repugnance
to any contact with the supernatural&mdash;and
now, oh! Caius, you behold me on
my way to Olbasanus, firmly resolved to
see with my own eyes what the gods have
allotted and at least to bear away the one
consolation that lies in the consciousness of
immutability and eternally predestined fate.”</p>

<p>“On your way to Olbasanus!” cried
Caius Bononius passionately. “Well, then,
let us not delay! I, too, am about to seek
him. I sent my Glabrio yesterday, and
Olbasanus appointed the second hour after
sunset....”</p>

<p>“You, too?” asked Lucius in surprise.</p>

<p>“Yes, I, too&mdash;though from different motives,
my dear Rutilius. I am a philosopher,
you know. For years I have searched
and investigated; I am acquainted with the
manifold appearances of animate and inanimate<span class="pagenum">[31]</span>
nature; I don’t believe in this conjuror’s
wonderful phantasmagoria. No matter,
the testimony of many truthful men lies
before us, I cannot doubt that they have
faithfully and honestly related what they
heard and saw. So a torturing contradiction
results. Either I am mistaken in denying,
with Pliny and Lucretius, the interference
of demons in the affairs of men, or all
these truthful people deceive themselves
and are the victims of base, unprincipled
fraud. Impelled by my curiosity, I am determined,
so far as possible, to decide this
question one way or another. So come,
that I may not miss the hour Olbasanus has
appointed.”</p>

<p>Lucius Rutilius felt a thrill of joyful fear.
A gleam of hope flashed through his soul,
for his friend’s words, spite of their measured
reserve, expressed strong confidence.</p>

<p>“Let us hurry!” he said, trembling with
impatience.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[32]</span></p>

<p>So the two friends went back into the
house, and passing around the Viminal Hill
by the side of the Tullian wall, turned
towards Olbasanus’ dwelling.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>


<p>Not far from the enormous Baths which
the Emperor Diocletian,&mdash;as if to atone for
preferring to reside in Nicomedia or Salona
rather than in Rome,&mdash;had had built on the
northeastern slope of the Viminal as far as
the spot where the height merges into the
Quirinal, there stood near the Collina Gate
a singular structure, almost recalling in the
ponderous splendor of its brilliantly-painted
façade the royal palaces of Assyria and
Persia, yet as fresh and new as if it had
just emerged from the hands of architect and
workmen, an architectural embodiment of
the taste of an age which had a fancy for
cleverly imitating the style of by-gone
times, not only in the weak creations of a
degenerate literature, but in other departments
of human activity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[34]</span></p>

<p>True, in this instance it had not been the
architect’s whim or his employer’s taste,
but a definite, practical purpose that had
replaced the simple façade of the Roman
dwelling by this fantastic luxury of the
East. Behind the ponderous pillars adorned
with heads of animals, Olbasanus, the Chaldean
enchanter and conjuror of evil spirits,
the declared favorite of the Roman ladies,
practised his mysterious arts,&mdash;and thus the
exterior of the spacious structure harmonized
with the strange events that occurred
within. The foreign aspect of the front
might be regarded as a preparation for the
chosen ones whom Olbasanus permitted to
cross the threshold of his secret sanctuary.</p>

<p>Lucius Rutilius and Caius Bononius
reached the door at the very moment it was
opened from within, allowing a tall, thin
figure, wrapped in a thick paenula, to pass
into the street. Spite of the mild weather,<span class="pagenum">[35]</span>
the stranger had drawn over his head the
hood worn as a protection from the rain.</p>

<p>Stepping a little aside, the two youths
made room for the disguised figure.</p>

<p>“I ought to know that gait and bearing,”
said Lucius Rutilius, looking after the
hurrying form; but he vainly strove to
recollect. Meantime the porter had not
closed the door, but holding a lantern of
chased silver with panes of oiled papyrus,
admitted the two visitors.</p>

<p>Caius Bononius gave him a silver coin
and asked if the Chaldean could be seen,
according to his appointment.</p>

<p>The porter beckoned to one of the
seven bearded Ethiopians who, clad in long
robes confined around the hips by wide
girdles inscribed with strange characters,
stood waiting at the entrance of the corridor,
and the man thus summoned silently
led the new arrivals through the wainscoted
ante-room. As he moved forward almost<span class="pagenum">[36]</span>
without a sound, the train of his cowl-like
robe rustling softly over the floor, holding
in his right hand a torch that cast spectral
shadows on the countless joints and projections
of the masonry, he himself seemed
a supernatural being, well calculated to
make a mysterious, agitating impression
upon sensitive souls. The way led through
a double row of short, heavy columns to a
staircase whose basalt steps extended
downward to a subterranean passage, just
high enough to permit a tall man to walk
upright under the ragged arch cut in the
forms of stalactites. The smoke from the
torch floated in horrible shapes along the
roof. A heavy, oppressive atmosphere prevailed.
On the right and left, in black
cavities, lay an endless number of skulls.
After a time the corridor turned; a second
gallery opened, from which branched a third
and fourth. At last the young men lost all
idea of the direction in which they were<span class="pagenum">[37]</span>
going. Lucius Rutilius thought they must
have long since reached the other side of
the hill; Caius Bononius, on the contrary,
was disposed to believe that the staircase
which now led them into a spacious, dimly-lighted
room, was not very far from the
entrance flight at the end of the pillared
corridor.</p>

<p>The apartment they entered was a masterpiece
in the effective use of architectural,
plastic, and decorative ornament. When
the Ethiopian had retired with his blazing
torch and let down the iron trap-door at the
top of the stairs, the two youths at first
supposed themselves to be in total darkness.
True, a tiny pale-blue flame was
burning at the back of the room in a candelabrum
about the height of a man; but
the rays it shed through the vast chamber
were not sufficient to show eyes dazzled
by the torch-glare anything more than the
glimmering outlines of huge, ponderous<span class="pagenum">[38]</span>
masses. By degrees, however, their vision
became accustomed to this feeble light, and
Caius and Lucius discovered the elliptical
arrangements of huge pillars, behind which
ran a deep corridor that looked almost
black. Only a pallid glimmer between the
shadows of the columns showed that on
the other side of this corridor extended a
wall, following the line of the room within.
Twelve of the pillars&mdash;that is, one-third of
the whole number&mdash;which were directly
opposite to the entrance, were artistically
draped with countless floating black hangings,
between which hung all kinds of
chains, cords for suspending lamps, and
other accessories, carefully arranged in such
a manner as not to weaken the impression
of height and space.</p>

<p>The ceiling of the room was slightly
arched, but its construction, owing to the
extreme height, could not be distinguished.
At the end of the apartment, in front of the<span class="pagenum">[39]</span>
candelabrum, was a large square altar, also
hung with dark cloth. Tripods, brazen
monopodia<a id="FNanchor_4_4" href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> covered with all kinds of
strange utensils, low stools, and various unrecognizable
articles were arranged in symmetrical
order on both sides. In the centre
of the floor lay a rug about thirty feet
square, painted or interwoven with mysterious
figures; on each corner stood a candlestick
even taller than the candelabrum at
the end.</p>

<p>The young men had about five minutes’
time in which to examine their surroundings
by the dim light of the livid flame, then
there was a sound like the distant notes of
an Aeolian harp and, without their knowing
how and whence he came, Olbasanus stood
behind the cloth-draped altar.</p>

<p>“You do not come alone, Caius Bononius!”
he said, in a musical voice. “No
matter&mdash;I know. Most mortals cherish<span class="pagenum">[40]</span>
scruples about approaching, relying solely
on their own strength, the rooms where the
gods are to reveal themselves directly and
indirectly. Let your companion, whoever
he may be, also draw near; his quiet, devout
presence will not disturb the Chaldean’s
work.”</p>

<p>“You are mistaken, Olbasanus,” replied
Caius Bononius, “the person accompanying
me is the one who longs to address a question
to the goddess. I, Caius Bononius,
only sent my messenger to you in behalf of
this youth; for, I confess, I never felt a desire
to lift the veil from the future.”</p>

<p>“I am mistaken,” replied Olbasanus.
“That is the lot of all human beings, and
mine also, so long as I speak to you only
as a feeble and perishable man. The favor
of the gods, when I appeal to them, first
casts into my soul the light that renders any
error impossible. Well! Olbasanus is disposed
to grant your wish, though as a man<span class="pagenum">[41]</span>
he cannot understand what could induce
you to use this evasion.”</p>

<p>“The reasons are of small importance,”
replied Bononius.</p>

<p>“Then you probably desire to have
your companion’s name remain concealed
from the prophet?”</p>

<p>Caius Bononius exchanged a hasty
glance with his friend, then turning to
Olbasanus, replied:</p>

<p>“If it is agreeable to you, yes!”</p>

<p>The Chaldean seemed to hesitate a few
seconds.</p>

<p>“Greater power is required of the magician’s
art when the questioner conceals his
name,” he said slowly; “but since you
earnestly desire....”</p>

<p>“We beseech it!” replied Bononius.</p>

<p>The Chaldean now came with measured
pace from behind the altar.</p>

<p>“Granted!” he said solemnly.</p>

<p>Then he stretched out his hand, in<span class="pagenum">[42]</span>
which gleamed a small ivory wand. Instantly
the spacious room glowed with a
light as bright as that of day. Lamps not
only burned in all the candelabra&mdash;but even
between the pillars flames seemed to spring
from the ground; shallow vessels appeared
in which jets of light blazed steadily.</p>

<p>The two youths were almost blinded by
the spectacle of this transformation. Lucius
pressed his hand to his brow as if bewildered;
Caius stood motionless, apparently
scrutinizing, considering, examining. At
last a smile of satisfaction flitted over his
face. He seemed to have found the solution
of this enigma, while Rutilius was still
enthralled by the impression the miracle
produced.</p>

<p>“Approach,” said the Chaldean in sonorous
tones. “Stranger, what do you desire
to know?”</p>

<p>Again the youths exchanged a glance;
then Rutilius said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[43]</span></p>

<p>“I would fain learn what the gods have
allotted to me, in case I fulfil the most
momentous and important design of my
life.”</p>

<p>Olbasanus delayed his answer as before.
At last he replied:</p>

<p>“I fear that is more vague than the gods
permit. Can you not put your question
more clearly; mention, without reserve, the
design of which you speak?”</p>

<p>Rutilius felt Bononius secretly touch his
arm.</p>

<p>“No,” he said quietly. “I beg you to
try whether an answer cannot be obtained,
even without a more exact definition.”</p>

<p>Olbasanus looked upward. A ray like a
flash of lightning darted down.</p>

<p>“Granted,” he said, turning to Rutilius.
“By all the terrors of the nether world, you
are a favorite of the gods; they bestow
such marked kindness only on the chosen
ones whom they wish to bless. They<span class="pagenum">[44]</span>
usually punish distrust of their interpreter
by perpetual silence.”</p>

<p>The two youths were growing more excited
every instant; Lucius, because the
Chaldean’s grave, dignified manner seemed
a warrant for the earnestness and truth of
what he was about to announce; Caius
Bononius, because he was greatly disappointed,&mdash;he
had been perfectly sure the
magician would say that Lucius’ wish was
not allowable.</p>

<p>Olbasanus now touched the altar with
his wand. A clear note, like that produced
by striking metal, echoed through the
room, and a boy clad in white entered
through the curtains at the right. He carried
a brazier filled with red-hot coals,
which he placed on one of the brass stools
beside Olbasanus.</p>

<p>“Bring in the victim,” said the Chaldean.</p>

<p>The lad withdrew. Olbasanus seized a<span class="pagenum">[45]</span>
shovel, filled it with burning coals and carried
it to one of the tripods, on which he
carefully spread them, then returning to
the altar raised his hands.</p>

<p>“Hecate!” he said in a hollow tone,
“Mistress of the Nether World, Princess of
Darkness and Shadows, Ruler of Demons
and Departed Spirits, omnipotent, awful
goddess! Neither primeval fate, nor any
of the higher gods opposes what we design.
So I implore thee to graciously grant what
Olbasanus timidly whispers. Disclose the
future to this youth, quench his thirst for
the unfathomable, fill his eyes with clear
vision, and teach him what ghosts and
demons from east to west impart to thee.
If thou art disposed to favor him who, like
so many hundred others, appeals to thee,
stir thy sacred element; let thy spirit fan
the fiery flame and animate it with thy immortal
breath!”</p>

<p>After these words he advanced a few<span class="pagenum">[46]</span>
steps to the tripod and gazed intently at
the glowing coals. Lucius and Caius had
also approached. Suddenly the bits of coal
began to move slowly. There was a surging
and seething, as if the force of some
unknown vitality pervaded the blazing
brands, until at last the movements grew
weaker and finally ceased.</p>

<p>The Chaldean stepped back, folded his
arms, and bowed.</p>

<p>The white-robed boy now appeared,
leading a black lamb by a rope that glistened
like silver. Binding the animal firmly
to the altar, he approached the two youths
and offered them an onyx dish. His attitude
was unmistakable. Lucius took some
gold coins from the purse hanging at his
belt and placed them in the vessel. The
boy thanked him and again retired behind
the curtain.</p>

<p>Olbasanus, holding his magic wand in
his right hand and pressing the left on his<span class="pagenum">[47]</span>
heart, lowered his eyes, saying to Lucius
Rutilius:</p>

<p>“Kneel, my son. According to ancient
custom we will slaughter a black animal to
the goddess of the Under World. Pray
that the holy rite may succeed! The entrails
of the beast, inspired by Hecate’s
divine breath, will announce to us what we
are striving to know&mdash;not in mysterious
symbols, which require interpretation, but
in plain characters that are familiar to
human eyes. Victim of Hecate, die!”</p>

<p>He raised the wand over his head. The
black lamb fell as if struck by lightning.
Directly after, two attendants on the sacrificial
rites appeared&mdash;pallid youths clad
in Greek chitons and Persian trousers, with
gay kerchiefs bound about their heads.</p>

<p>“Stranger,”&mdash;Olbasanus turned to Lucius,&mdash;“approach
and touch the animal which
has succumbed to the attack of my helpful
demons.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[48]</span></p>

<p>Lucius Rutilius, who was growing more
timid and faint-hearted every moment, advanced.
The animal’s limbs were already
stiff. As the youth grasped the woolly
fleece, the lamb’s head fell back, showing
the glazed eyes.</p>

<p>The attendants removed the rug from
the altar-slab and laid the victim on it;
while Lucius Rutilius held the beast’s forefoot
clasped in his left hand, one of the
youths gave the Chaldean the knife. The
lamb was opened and Olbasanus, muttering
all sorts of magic formulas, removed the
heart and the liver. The next moment the
animal was taken away and the altar
cleansed from the blood by large linen
cloths dyed black.</p>

<p>Olbasanus held the heart and liver in
his outstretched left hand until the slaves
had put a brazen plate on the altar, then
laying the entrails on the metal, he waved
his wand and said to Lucius:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[49]</span></p>

<p>“Approach and read!”</p>

<p>At these words a sound like the roll of
thunder echoed through the room. Lucius
Rutilius, with a throbbing heart, bent over
the plate. There, in the centre of the still-smoking
liver, appeared in distinct Greek
letters:</p>

<p class="center">ΘΑΝΑΤΟΣ&mdash;Death.</p>

<p>The young patrician staggered back.</p>

<p>“Death!” he murmured, as if benumbed.</p>

<p>Caius Bononius had also advanced to
read the large, somewhat irregular characters
of the prophecy. Panting for breath,
he gnawed his lips, frowned, and clenched
his fist, as if he needed some physical
means to help him resist the impression of
this incomprehensible miracle. He acknowledged
to himself that he lacked any explanation
for it; yet his clear, unprejudiced
reason rebelled against what his eyes could<span class="pagenum">[50]</span>
not deny. He touched the writing with his
finger&mdash;it did not wipe off. That Olbasanus
had not written it himself, either before
or while he placed the liver on the metal
plate, Caius Bononius could swear by all
the gods. Already a troubled “If it should
be true?” was darting through his mind,
when glancing aside he detected the almost
imperceptible smile with which the magician
was watching the sceptical examination of
the inscription. To the young man’s penetration
this smile contained a singular meaning.
It was not the lofty expression of pity
and divinely-bestowed power, which in the
full possession of its sacred might looks condescendingly
down upon the bewildered
doubter; but the crafty smile of the Greek
who has succeeded in defrauding his foe of a
piece in the game of draughts, or the daring
adventurer who has accomplished a bold
deed and successfully effaced every trace of
his action. Thus, in this strange fashion,<span class="pagenum">[51]</span>
the philosopher, where logic left him in the
lurch, drew fresh power of resistance from
the domain of feeling; the instinct that led
him to consider the affair trivial because
the person was suspicious.</p>

<p>“Do you still doubt, Caius?” whispered
Lucius with quivering lips. “Come; I
know enough now. How I shall bear it
remains in the hands of the gods.”</p>

<p>“I doubt more than ever,” replied Bononius.
“The day will come when I shall
unravel this mystery. Now, I beseech you,
don’t desert me and above all yourself and
your hopes so unceremoniously. Put more
questions to him, ask for other signs! They
say he makes the goddess’s voice speak
from a skull; and Heliodorus’ daughter herself
wrote to you that the magician brought
Hecate’s flaming form from the night-heavens.
Outweigh his marvels with gold, but
let him do what he can, for the sake of truth
and the prosperity of your happy future. I<span class="pagenum">[52]</span>
now long more than ever to behold&mdash;and
be able to despise&mdash;all his arts.”</p>

<p>“You are blaspheming, Caius!” said the
startled Lucius. “Suppose the terrible goddess,
the destroyer of my life, should punish
you!”</p>

<p>“Punish me? For what? If it <em>is</em> she,
she ought to be grateful to me for revealing
the abuse of her name; but it is not, otherwise
she would have dragged yonder fellow
into the eternal gulf long ago.”</p>

<p>A pause ensued. Olbasanus seemed to
be secretly gloating over the impression his
prophecy had produced on the two young
men, for he imagined that Caius Bononius’s
whispered words were the expression of
wondering anxiety.</p>

<p>“The Mistress of Night has prophesied
death to me,” Rutilius at last began. “But
one thing still weighs on my mind. May I
be permitted to question farther?”</p>

<p>“Question,” replied Olbasanus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[53]</span></p>

<p>“Then I would fain know whether this
destiny can be averted by no sacrifice, no
deed of expiation. If it is in your power,
let me learn this. Implore the goddess to
pronounce the oracle to the questioner in
her own terrible voice.”</p>

<p>As before the Chaldean looked upward;
as before lightning flashed; and raising his
wand he exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Granted!”</p>

<p>Again he drew from the altar the mysterious
metallic sound that summoned the
white-robed boy. At an unintelligible order
from the Chaldean, the lad went to a
monopodium that stood near and took from
it a little casket set with gems, which he
placed beside the magician. Then the onyx
vessel again appeared, and Lucius Rutilius’s
gold coins fell rattling within. Directly
after the dark curtain between the two pillars
behind the altar was drawn aside, revealing
a semicircular niche lighted by a<span class="pagenum">[54]</span>
bluish lamp. The wizard took from the
casket a small vessel, whose contents he
burned on the brazier of coals. A fragrant
smoke rose to the ceiling, and at the same
moment all the lights went out except the
bluish lamp, whose glimmering rays showed
a grinning skull on the floor of the niche.</p>

<p>Olbasanus beckoned to the questioner.
Resting both hands on the altar, Lucius
Rutilius was to gaze into the ghostly niche
and hear the decree of the terrible goddess.
As Caius Bononius also wished to see and
hear, he, too, was obliged to grasp the edge
of the altar with his right hand.</p>

<p>“Be silent and vanish, ye spirits and
demons,” the Chaldean now began in a
mysterious tone. “Be silent and vanish,
for Hecate, the Inscrutable, will herself
speak to this creature of the dust through
the symbol of her omnipotence, the skull on
the floor of her sanctuary. The fleshless,
brainless skeleton, once the seat of thought,<span class="pagenum">[55]</span>
the extinct lamp of a long-forgotten human
life, will serve the Invisible One for an abode
when she rises from the depths of the
nether-world. Announce to me, Omnipotent
One, has the breath of thy divine life
entered this mouldering shell?”</p>

<p>A hollow, horrible: “Thou sayest it,”
echoed from the lofty forehead of the
skull.</p>

<p>Lucius Rutilius started violently. Caius
Bononius thought himself deceived in the
direction from which the voice came, and
leaning forward listened breathlessly.</p>

<p>Olbasanus had bowed his face upon the
altar, as if the presence of the immortal
goddess bent his head in timid reverence.
Now he slowly rose.</p>

<p>“Be merciful unto us, Thou Mistress of
all!” he said, extending his hands towards
the niche as if imploring protection. “This
youth desires to know whether the destiny
thy sternness predicts is as inevitable as a<span class="pagenum">[56]</span>
decree of fate, and if not&mdash;what he must
do to avert the terrible doom.”</p>

<p>After a pause the voice again echoed
from the skull: “His fate is inevitable if he
executes what he has planned,” came from
the horrible cavity in a whisper so distinct
that even Bononius could no longer doubt.
“In resignation lies the sole salvation of his
life. This, Hecate, who removes all that
her breath has touched, announces to him.”</p>

<p>With these words a terrible peal of
thunder resounded through the hall. The
skull in the niche began to stir, and&mdash;incredible
marvel&mdash;grow smaller, like a cloud
in the evening sky which gradually melts into
nothing. The two young men gazed
fixedly at the mysterious phenomenon.
Two minutes more, and the skull had entirely
vanished from the shining floor&mdash;it
had not sunk into the earth, but, as it were,
fallen to pieces, blown away, dissolved in
smoke like a phantom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[57]</span></p>

<p>When Caius Bononius looked up, he saw
his friend lying apparently lifeless on the
altar steps.</p>

<p>“It is all over,” he murmured, pale with
horror, as Bononius touched him on the
shoulder.</p>

<p>For a time Caius left the sorrowing
youth to his despair. Olbasanus, who was
probably accustomed to such scenes, waited
silently a few steps off.</p>

<p>“Lucius,” the young sage began after a
little hesitation, “consider only one thing!
The gods, if they exist, must be regarded
as the incarnation of everything that is sublime.
But the nobler, purer, and therefore
more akin to the gods a man’s nature is, the
more decidedly he is repelled by the horrible
and ghostly. The very idea of divinities,
even of a deity ruling the realm of
death, forbids us to believe incidents such
as we have just witnessed to be the expression
of their will. I, too, cannot guess this<span class="pagenum">[58]</span>
Chaldean’s enigmas; but I doubt with all
the power of my mind that they are what
he declares them to be. Do you also doubt,
Lucius! Own to him that you do; don’t
spare your money, and ask fresh testimony.
Your Hero, you said, <em>saw</em> the goddess of
death; do you, too, request a sight of her,
in order either to believe implicitly or find
the lever by which you can overthrow all
these incomprehensible things.”</p>

<p>This time there was some delay before
Lucius Rutilius could be persuaded. But at
last, becoming more and more influenced
by his friend’s calmness, he yielded and
made the request Bononius directed.</p>

<p>Olbasanus’s penetration had long since
anticipated this turn of affairs. He silently
led the two youths through half-a-dozen
paths running in different directions across
the dark park. Situated on a gently-rising
hill, the magician’s garden covered a square
of several hundred feet, which was enclosed<span class="pagenum">[59]</span>
like a sanctuary by walls almost as high as
a house, and overgrown with ivy and other
climbing vines. Here and there fountains
played in alabaster basins; strange statues,
looking like pallid shades in the starlight of
the moonless night, stood like spectral
guards amid the shrubbery. Ancient evergreen-oaks
and plane-trees spread their
many-branching crowns.</p>

<p>In the centre of the grounds was a circle
about sixty yards in diameter. Here
the magician paused with his companions.</p>

<p>“Your wish is a presumptuous one!”
he said to Lucius Rutilius. “Only in rare
cases does the goddess grant so insolent a
desire. But you, I repeat, seem to be
chosen as an object of her special favor.
Hecate”&mdash;he folded his arms across his
breast&mdash;“wills it, and will appear to you.
Nay, she will even tolerate the presence of
him who stands as a sympathizing friend by
your side. But&mdash;I warn you! Remember<span class="pagenum">[60]</span>
Semele, who wished to behold Zeus in all
his Olympian majesty and was consumed
in anguish in his arms. True, death and
destruction will not come to you from the
sight of the Inscrutable One, for she appears
of her own free will, not constrained
by any oath binding upon the gods. But
even thus the vision will confuse your mind
and senses, stir your heart with dread and
horror. Surrounded by scorching flames
she will cross the starry sky, visible only to
your eyes and mine, and overwhelming awe
will stream from her shoulders like rain
from a thunder-cloud. Never will you be
able to efface this terrible spectacle from
your memory. Therefore, do not brave the
crushing vision too long! As soon as you
have once beheld it, bow your head in reverence
and hide your face with your trembling
hands. No question to the Immortal One
is needed. Her voice has already announced
that your destiny is fixed; therefore<span class="pagenum">[61]</span>
she will come from the left, from the
regions of the west; and flame across to
the east. If her own favor and mercy
could avert this fate&mdash;and she alone in rare
cases can loose bonds the fettered one himself
could rend by no sacrifice, no atonement&mdash;she
would rise from the right like
the sun and vanish towards the left. Now,&mdash;are
you prepared?”</p>

<p>“We are,” replied Rutilius.</p>

<p>Olbasanus threw himself on the ground.
Gently striking his forehead thrice against
the hard trodden earth, he cried in a tone
of despairing fervor:</p>

<p>“Hecate, Princess of the Nether World,
Mistress of all that has breath, show thyself
to the eyes of this chosen youth,
and, if it is possible for thee, rise from the
regions of the east.”</p>

<p>Suddenly a strange, ghostly rustling
echoed on the air, a whirring like the distant
sound of mighty wings. A blazing<span class="pagenum">[62]</span>
fiery glare flamed in the sky&mdash;but from
the west. The apparition crossed the heavens
with furious speed,&mdash;half concealed by
the boughs of a row of lofty elms.</p>

<p>“Hide your faces, unhappy men!” the
Chaldean had shouted at the first ray of
light, and in tones so sharp, so full of real
terror, that Lucius Rutilius involuntarily
obeyed.</p>

<p>Even Caius Bononius had shrunk back
and did not look up fairly and steadily until
the fiery vision had already sunk far in the
east behind the dark horizon.</p>

<p>Lucius Rutilius, half fainting with excitement,
was led away by Olbasanus and
Caius Bononius. The Chaldean interrupted
a question from the latter by the quiet
remark:</p>

<p>“The time Olbasanus placed at your
disposal has long since elapsed. Other
grief-laden mortals are already impatiently
awaiting his aid.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[63]</span></p>

<p>At the end of five minutes Lucius
Rutilius had recovered sufficiently to set out
on his way home with the young philosopher.
When Caius Bononius, on reaching
his friend’s house, held out his hand, whispering:
“Calm yourself, Lucius,” he received
no reply. Staggering like a drunken
man Lucius hurried through the passage
leading from the door to the atrium, and
sought his couch, to lie awake all night.</p>

<p>Caius Bononius also found himself indescribably
agitated. The gulf between
what he had witnessed and what his reason
and judgment had long since decided concerning
the nature of things and the meaning
of the world was too irreconcilable, not
to lead the mind of one so eager in the pursuit
of knowledge to try to restore in some
way the interrupted harmony. Until early
dawn he paced by lamplight up and down
his study or the peristyle, searching, weighing,
and rejecting, till at last, almost tired<span class="pagenum">[64]</span>
to death, he flung himself, still in his toga
and tunic, upon his couch and fell asleep.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div><!--Page break for ePub-->
<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>


<p>From the time of his visit to Olbasanus
Lucius Rutilius, who had previously constantly
endeavored to obtain a meeting with
his beloved Hero to cheer the sorrowing
girl and induce her to change her desperate
resolve, was completely transformed.</p>

<p>Gifted with a larger share of imagination
than of calm, unprejudiced investigation;
endowed with genuine poetic receptivity for
all external impressions, he doubted neither
the honesty of the mysterious Chaldean,
nor the truth of what he had heard and seen.</p>

<p>As Caius Bononius was unable to give<span class="pagenum">[65]</span>
any natural explanation of the marvels they
had witnessed, his efforts, when he visited
his friend the next day and earnestly endeavored
to weaken, as far as possible, the
impressions of the preceding evening, remained
unavailing.</p>

<p>Since Rutilius was now convinced that
the ardently-desired union with his beloved
Hero would inevitably bring destruction, not
only to himself but to her and her dear
father, duty and honor seemed to him to
command that he should not render the unavoidable
separation more difficult by delay
and hesitation, but accomplish it at once
through a heroic resolve. Even one more
interview&mdash;a last farewell must be avoided&mdash;on
this point he now agreed with the
woman he loved. The arrows that had
pierced so deeply into their yearning hearts
must be torn out by force; only thus, under
the merciful protection of the gods, deliverance
might yet be possible; if not for<span class="pagenum">[66]</span>
him&mdash;for he felt that without Hero life,
even amid all the splendors of the world,
would lack light, and color&mdash;perhaps for
her, who could forget, who ought and must
forget, though the very thought made the
youth tremble.</p>

<p>He therefore wrote to Hero briefly, that
he, too, had heard the decree of the goddess
of death and was convinced that the inexorable
will of Fate stood between them&mdash;so
he would resign her. With what
feelings he did so, he need not explain. As
he wished her to regain her peace of mind,
he informed her that he could not remain
longer in Rome, where he should run the
risk of meeting her and thus being reminded
afresh of the happiness he had forever
lost. He would leave the Capital the
following day, without naming the goal of
his journey, that not even her thoughts
should follow him.</p>

<p>Lucius carried out this resolution with<span class="pagenum">[67]</span>
the haste of a man who hopes to fly from
himself.</p>

<p>Accompanied only by a single slave, he
rode at dawn northward across the Milvian
Bridge&mdash;towards Etruria, to pass by Pisae,
renowned of old, to Gaul. He had visited
none of his numerous friends before leaving
except Caius Bononius, to whom he
named Massilia<a id="FNanchor_5_5" href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> as the place where he intended
to remain for a few months. He
had in that city, in the person of an Arpinatian
knight, a host who would receive him
with open arms.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Meantime Caius Bononius was haunted
night and day by the feverish desire to see
clearly into the tangled web of the events
he had experienced.</p>

<p>If the marvellous incidents at the Chaldean<span class="pagenum">[68]</span>
enchanter’s house had been less numerous;
if&mdash;with all their apparent reality&mdash;they
had not borne a certain theatrical impress,
Bononius would have been disposed
to enter more seriously than ever into the
question: Is there really a higher spiritual
power that rules the souls of the departed,
and are there men who, in consequence of
the peculiar nature of their mental faculties,
are capable of entering into mutual relations
with this higher power?</p>

<p>The studies in which Bononius had been
engaged contradicted the truth of such a
hypothesis; they did not yield the smallest
fact that could be construed in favor of
it. Yet,&mdash;it is the brain most free from
prejudice, the brain that has learned how
often the impossible proves true, which is
therefore the first to be ready to examine
impartially what is strange and contradictory
instead of unceremoniously refusing it
authority with the cheap cleverness of average<span class="pagenum">[69]</span>
minds. The true thinker does not reject
what lies beyond the pale of experience,
but simply what is logically inconceivable.</p>

<p>Thus Olbasanus would have obtained
undisputed success with Caius Bononius if
instead of <em>three</em> amazing miracles he had
displayed only one. But the instinct that
was instantly aroused when Bononius detected
the magician’s triumphant smile
gave him no rest; with the zeal of the
investigator who hopes to make a discovery
that will move the world, the young philosopher
strove to find the most natural and
simple explanation possible for the bewildering
phenomena.... A hundred times he
fancied he had grasped the truth by the
wing, but it constantly escaped him, and
the joyous gleam of hope proved illusive.</p>

<p>There were two circumstances that gave
him food for reflection.</p>

<p>In the first place, even with the most
comprehensive knowledge of all the powers<span class="pagenum">[70]</span>
of nature, it was not to be explained how
the answer to Lucius Rutilius’s question,
which Olbasanus did not know, agreed so
exactly with the reply to Hero’s. The
second circumstance appeared no less perplexing.
If this Olbasanus was really a
juggler, who deceived his victims for his
own selfish designs, what could have been
more opportune than a final compliance
with Lucius Rutilius’s wishes? The Chaldean
might have imposed any penance on
the sorrowing youth, and if he had only
wanted money, named a very considerable
sum by whose payment to the goddess’s
representative the pretended fate could be
averted. But there was nothing of the sort.
Olbasanus’s goddess persisted, with the inexorable
severity of Fate, in the prophecy
already made by the writing on the entrails
of the victim. This fact told very decidedly
in the sorcerer’s favor. What interest could
the man be pursuing when, against his better<span class="pagenum">[71]</span>
judgment, he destroyed a lover’s hopes,
since their restoration undoubtedly promised
to be far more profitable to the soothsayer.</p>

<p>The youth could find no explanation for
these things.</p>

<p>One day&mdash;about a week after Lucius
Rutilius’s departure&mdash;he was walking
through the avenues of the Campus Martius.
Caius had long neglected this afternoon
exercise of several hours before dinner;
now, when his head was burning
from the constant restlessness of his excited
thoughts, he had resumed the old custom,
and to-day, for the fourth time, set out on
his usual walk to the so-called Septae, the
place where the ancient assemblies of the
people were held, past the spreading
boughs of the double row of maples, whose
rustling foliage already began to assume
the brilliant hues of autumn.</p>

<p>Spite of the lateness of the season the<span class="pagenum">[72]</span>
air was as soft and mild as that of spring.
A brilliant throng filled the carriage-roads
and bridle-paths. Aristocratic dames were
borne in magnificent litters through the
laurel and myrtle groves, followed by a
train of gaily-attired cavaliers&mdash;for the
white toga of ancient Rome had long since
ceased to be the exclusive costume of these
fashionable gallants. Rich manufacturers
from Alexandria rolled in the two-wheeled
cisium, preceded by woolly-haired runners
in bright red garments, side by side with the
magnificent carriage of the senator who
prided himself on his noble blood and the
glittering pony chaise of the woman of the
demi monde with her towering coiffure&mdash;the
“Libertina,” of whom Ovid has sung.
Wrestling and throwing the discus were
practised on the stretches of turf; but the
combatants merely played clever tricks on
each other&mdash;compared with the fierce athletes
who had steeled their muscles here<span class="pagenum">[73]</span>
under Tiberius and Caligula&mdash;and the discus
had grown smaller, as if intended for
boys, a symbol of the increasing degeneracy
which was finally to succumb to the mighty
assault of the victorious German tribes.</p>

<p>Caius Bononius walked through this
splendid labyrinth like a somnambulist.
Even here, amid the merry, frivolous population
of the world’s capital, he could not shake
off the burden weighing upon his heart and
brain. On the evening he met Rutilius
he had been on his way to detect the
vanity of Olbasanus’ arts&mdash;and the consequence
was that he found himself more
than ever ensnared in the net of uncertainty.
There was a touch of the tragi comical in
this condition of affairs. Bononius, as he
paced to and fro, had the vague feeling that
he was playing a somewhat pitiful part
before himself and the aristocratic company
assembled under the maples....</p>

<p>Suddenly some one called him by name.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[74]</span></p>

<p>He turned.</p>

<p>“Is it you, Philippus?” he exclaimed, as
a stately man about thirty-six years old
approached him from a side-path. The
new-comer wore the military dress of a
centurion (captain) of the city prefect; his
features expressed resolute will, combined
with unmistakable kindness of heart and
frankness.</p>

<p>“How are you, Bononius?” asked the
soldier, offering the young philosopher his
hand. “Are you still alive, or is it only
your shade wandering here? By Hercules!
it’s at least three months since I last had
the pleasure of shaking hands with you.
What are you doing, you incomprehensible
hermit? Still melting metals on the tripod,
or again busied with Heraclitus’ horrible
writings? It must be something terrible
that estranges you so entirely from your
best friends.”</p>

<p>“You are right,” said Bononius. “I<span class="pagenum">[75]</span>
have been unusually busy during the last
few months. But you see I’m improving.”</p>

<p>They walked on for some distance side
by side. The young man liked to listen to
the fresh, kindly talk of the sturdy centurion,
who now criticised a horse, now
spoke of the last races and the newest
pantomime, or with blunt originality expressed
his admiration of one of the celebrated
beauties who passed reclining among
the cushions of their litters or calashes.</p>

<p>“Look there!” he said suddenly, checking
the torrent of his eloquence. “No,
can it be possible? How pale she looks!...
Don’t you know her&mdash;Hero, Heliodorus’
daughter?”</p>

<p>Caius Bononius started violently. He
had never seen the object of Lucius Rutilius’
love, much as his thoughts had been
occupied with her during the last week.
There was no apparent reason for seeking
her; nay, by going to the Sicilian’s house<span class="pagenum">[76]</span>
he would have frustrated his self-sacrificing
friend’s expressed wish. But now, since
chance had caused this meeting, the young
man felt as if he had only needed a glimpse
of Hero to obtain a clear insight into all
the enigmas that tortured him. He almost
devoured with his eyes the lovely girlish
figure which, wrapped in the folds of a
dazzlingly white palla, was just turning into
the elm avenue by the side of a thin young
man.</p>

<p>Pretty Hero was indeed pale; pale and
sad, despite the faint smile of courtesy that
hovered around the small, pouting mouth,
and the impression was increased by her
thick, light-brown hair, which in a simple,
waving line framed the symmetrical brow.
She gazed without interest at the motley
throng, listened unsympathizingly to the
eager words of her excited companion.
Behind her, by the side of a fresh, blooming
girl of fifteen, whom Caius Bononius<span class="pagenum">[77]</span>
supposed to be the Lydia so often mentioned
by Rutilius, walked Heliodorus, the
father of the pallid Hero, evidently in an
angry mood, for his brows were contracted,
his lips tightly compressed. He seemed
to be absorbed in an earnest conversation
with Lydia.</p>

<p>“Is that Hero?” asked Bononius.
“And who is the unattractive fellow talking
to her so eagerly?”</p>

<p>“Agathon, a countryman of Heliodorus.
I’ve often met him at the city prefect’s.”</p>

<p>Bononius and Philippus now passed the
group. Philippus bowed. Bononius gazed
fixedly now at Hero, now at her companion,
Agathon. There was something in this
man’s appearance which seemed familiar,
though he thought he most distinctly remembered
that he had never met him
before in his life. So he forgot all regard
for courtesy, and when Heliodorus had also
passed with Lydia, Caius Bononius, spite of<span class="pagenum">[78]</span>
the city custom which forbade such things,
could not refrain from gazing after their
retreating figures.</p>

<p>When he thus caught a back view of
Agathon’s form a recollection like a revelation
suddenly darted through his brain.
That was the same thin figure which, on the
evening he was standing with Lucius
Rutilius at Olbasanus’ door, came out of the
ostium<a id="FNanchor_6_6" href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> and walked away. The bearing,
the peculiar movement of the right shoulder,
the whole appearance,&mdash;all was unmistakable.</p>

<p>The young man now clearly perceived
what had hitherto been as incomprehensible
to him as the wondrous nocturnal apparitions&mdash;Olbasanus’
motives. Everything
Olbasanus had predicted to the unhappy
Rutilius and sorrowing Hero was by
Agathon’s direction. The motive that influenced
the latter required no explanation.<span class="pagenum">[79]</span>
Hero was young, beautiful, rich,&mdash;and
Agathon was a suitor for her favor. Caius
Bononius especially emphasized the wealth&mdash;it
already filled him with satisfaction to
be able to despise the aforesaid. Agathon
more heartily than would have been allowable
if his intrigue had been caused solely
by a mad passion for the charming young
girl.</p>

<p>True, this discovery did not make the
incomprehensible things Rutilius and Bononius
had witnessed in the Chaldean’s house
one hair’s breadth more intelligible; but
Bononius had gained fresh courage and
energy to advance, by the employment of
every possible means, towards the goal on
which, freed from the last remnants of metaphysical
doubts, he now boldly fixed his
gaze. He was now aware that Olbasanus
was no fanatic, no enthusiast who at least
partially deceived himself, but a juggler,
who served as the tool of the base selfishness<span class="pagenum">[80]</span>
of a malicious sneak. This juggler
must be unmasked&mdash;the youth’s determination
to do this was as firm as the devotee’s
faith in the mercy of deity.</p>

<p>The centurion had noticed his companion’s
agitation and, with his natural
frankness and absence of reserve, asked
what there was in the Sicilian’s appearance
to cause so much surprise&mdash;had Caius
Bononius discovered in Hero some neighbor
at the circus, for whom he had long
sought in vain, or recognized in Agathon
a troublesome rival? The youth was in a
mood that renders the heart communicative
and desirous of seeking counsel from others;
he had long prized the centurion as a reliable
and discreet man; besides, he thought
he perceived that Philippus also cherished
no special regard for Agathon.</p>

<p>One word led to another.</p>

<p>Strolling a little apart from the throng,
Bononius at first gave the centurion some<span class="pagenum">[81]</span>
hints and then, after Philippus had sworn
by all the gods to maintain the most inviolable
secrecy, told him the adventure at
Olbasanus’s.</p>

<p>The worthy centurion was frantic with
indignation. He had never believed in the
conjuror’s fool-tricks; but here the whole
thing was as clear as day: Agathon, the
base sharper, had bought Olbasanus! He,
Philippus, knew that Agathon’s money matters
were very much involved. Of course,
the extravagant roué thought he could find
no better investment for the few hundred
sesterces remaining out of many millions
than to use them in obtaining the immense
heritage Hero, as her mother’s only
child, would bring as a marriage dowry.
The matter was as clear as sunlight. But
the insolent cheat had not reaped his harvest
yet&mdash;and, judging by the expression
on Hero’s pretty face, Philippus considered
it doubtful whether he ever would win what<span class="pagenum">[82]</span>
he wished to sneak into so craftily. No
matter: Agathon’s probable failure did not
make amends for the harm the abominable
conjuror had done poor Rutilius. He,
Philippus, would do everything in his power,
in company with Caius Bononius, to set the
affair to rights.</p>

<p>“Come and breakfast with me to-morrow!”
he said at last, after mentioning all
these points with excited volubility. “We’ll
sketch the plan of a campaign that will not
only restore our worthy Lucius Rutilius to
happiness, but satisfy your ardent curiosity
about the secret powers with which Olbasanus
works.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” replied Bononius. “I’ll
be there.”</p>

<p>So they parted.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>


<p>Three days after the interview between
Caius and the centurion the Chaldean sorcerer
received a note, trebly sealed, containing
the following lines:</p>

<p>“Lydia to the glorious Olbasanus, the
confidant of the gods.</p>

<p>“I do not know whether you will still
remember me. I crossed your threshold
with the fair-haired girl from Syracuse,
whom your divine prophecy saved from the
most terrible misfortune. Her name is
Hero, and she is a daughter of the estimable
Heliodorus, who came last year to the
strand of Tiber. Filled with admiration for
your incomprehensible art, Lydia begs the
counsel of the omniscient enchanter in an
important and troublesome matter, whose
details I cannot confide to you in this letter.<span class="pagenum">[84]</span>
But a fever which, though not dangerous,
confines me to my bed prevents my seeking
you at your own house. So, worthy Olbasanus,
accept in return for your trouble
the three hundred denarii the boy will give
you with these lines, and come as soon as
your leisure will permit to the dwelling of
her who seeks knowledge. You know the
mansion with the Corinthian <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">porticus</i> on
the northern slope of the Caelian hill.
Tell me, by the slave, whether and when
my impatient heart may expect you.”</p>

<p>Olbasanus took the gold and wrote
three words on one of the numerous strips
of parchment which, daintily cut and piled
one above another, were lying in a niche in
the wall of his room. It was still early&mdash;scarcely
an hour after sunrise; the conjuror’s
labors, as a rule, did not begin until
after the so-called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">prandium</i>, or second
breakfast, and were most numerous during
the evening hours. So he could reply<span class="pagenum">[85]</span>
“Will come immediately!”&mdash;“for,” he
added with courteous phraseology, “Olbasanus
knows that he who gives quickly, gives
doubly.”</p>

<p>Twenty minutes after Olbasanus’s litter,
radiant with gold and purple, borne by four
coal-black Nubian slaves, stopped in front
of Heliodorus’s vestibule. Such visits from
the soothsayer and magician to aristocratic
Roman ladies were neither unusual nor remarkable,
though Olbasanus was somewhat
chary of granting the favor.</p>

<p>The Chaldean was respectfully received
at the door by the chief slave of the atrium,
who begged him to excuse the absence of
the members of his master’s family; Heliodorus
had been detained in Antium for
several days by important business, and
Hero, his daughter, had gone to rest at a
late hour and was still asleep.</p>

<p>Olbasanus nodded with the quiet formality
of a man accustomed to such phrases,<span class="pagenum">[86]</span>
and allowed himself to be conducted to the
large sitting-room under the columns of the
peristyle, where Lydia, reclining on a brass
lounge, awaited him.</p>

<p>As he crossed the threshold the young
Sicilian rose, greeted him with great embarrassment,
and requested him to follow
her.</p>

<p>Behind the sitting-room was a windowless,
oval <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">exedra</i><a id="FNanchor_7_7" href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> lighted from above&mdash;the
apartment specially designed for the social
chat so greatly prized and enjoyed by the
Romans even in later times.</p>

<p>Into this cosy private room Lydia conducted
the smiling Oriental, who read in
her timid confusion assurance of victory won
and fresh triumphs for the future.</p>

<p>But scarcely had the folding doors closed
behind Olbasanus, when from the opposite
ones three strong Germans rushed in and
seized him as a pack of hounds fall upon a<span class="pagenum">[87]</span>
wolf. Spite of his desperate resistance, he
was bound; a gag, thrust by the flaxen-haired
Frieselanders between his jaws,
barely allowed him to breathe.</p>

<p>At the same time Caius Bononius and
the centurion Philippus entered the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">exedra</i>
by a side door.</p>

<p>“Why do you roll your eyes so, conjuror
of Hecate?” said Bononius. “It
will be an easy matter for the confidant of
all the spirits of the Upper and Lower
World to burst these bonds asunder and
hurl the criminals who have assailed him
lifeless on the floor.”</p>

<p>Spite of the defiant scorn these words
were intended to express, the young man’s
voice had trembled. The glances that
flashed from under the Oriental’s lashes
were so fierce and diabolical, and the memory
of the events in the enchanter’s house
on the Quirinal so fresh, that Bononius
could not without emotion see the conquered<span class="pagenum">[88]</span>
man at his feet,&mdash;for in the struggle with
the slaves Olbasanus had sunk upon his
knees.</p>

<p>At a sign from the centurion Philippus,
the flaxen-haired Frieselanders now retired
through the same door by which they had
entered. He himself approached the fettered
captive, drew his sword from its sheath,
and said in curt, resolute tones:</p>

<p>“You have been guilty of an execrable
crime. Recognize in me a commander of
the armed body appointed to guard the
welfare of the citizens. I could arrest you
now without ceremony. Your fate would
be undoubted; since, apart from your
offence against Lucius Rutilius and Heliodorus’s
daughter, the edicts of former emperors,
prohibiting Chaldeans and mathematicians
a residence in the seven-hilled city
on pain of death, are still in force. That
the authorities have been negligent in
executing these edicts; that an indulgence<span class="pagenum">[89]</span>
has prevailed of whose injurious results you
are the best proof, has little to do with the
matter. Yet,&mdash;spite of your criminality, I
will exercise mercy, if you will punctiliously
fulfil two conditions that I shall impose. If
you wish to hear them, give me some sign!”</p>

<p>Olbasanus, who at Caius Bononius’s
words had perceived that his rôle in Rome
was played out, after a slight delay bowed
his head like a man who submits to the inevitable.
The soldier’s quiet, resolute
manner did not permit him to doubt that
Philippus would execute his threat.</p>

<p>Lydia, who had hitherto remained aloof,
now advanced a few steps and gazed with
timid curiosity at the magician whom, notwithstanding
Caius Bononius’s repeated
admonitions, she still regarded as a sort of
supernatural being.</p>

<p>True&mdash;the pitiable abjectness which now
took the place of his former rage was well
calculated to shake this superstitious dread.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[90]</span></p>

<p>“Very well,” said Philippus to Olbasanus,
“I’ll release you from the gag, that you
may speak. But if you should cry out
or attempt to frighten this young girl by
magic formulas or any folly of that sort,
my blade shall duly repay you for it.”</p>

<p>With these words he removed the gag
from the enchanter’s mouth.</p>

<p>“My conditions,” he continued, “are
simple enough. You perceive, Olbasanus,
that we have discovered the true character
of your incredible frauds, but we still lack
the key to some of your criminal arts.
This youth, who crossed your threshold for
the sole purpose of seeing behind the curtain
of the nonsensical conjurations with
which you deluded people, requires a complete
and truthful explanation of everything
you did to deceive Hero and Rutilius. If
you refuse or lie, our Germans shall drag
you to prison this very day. You will also
mention the person to whom you sold yourself<span class="pagenum">[91]</span>
for such reprehensible jugglery. The
making of these confessions is my first condition.
The second is&mdash;that you leave
Rome before the end of the year. Go to
Nicomedia or Alexandria, for aught I care;
if these cities will tolerate your presence&mdash;and
a man of your appearance doesn’t pass
unobserved&mdash;that’s your affair. But here
in Rome, where you have not only deluded
a populace entrusted as it were to my
charge, but my best friends, here I oppose
to you my threatening sword&mdash;woe betide
you, if you despise the menace! If you fulfil
the task I impose, you shall be dismissed
unharmed. Consider quickly and answer
without circumlocution.”</p>

<p>Olbasanus, with the keen penetration of
the Oriental, had instantly perceived the
whole situation. He felt that it was not
hatred and revenge that roused these men
against him, but on the part of one friendship
for the basely deceived Lucius Rutilius,<span class="pagenum">[92]</span>
on that of the other feverish curiosity to
learn the causes of the mysterious effects,
which&mdash;he himself did not know how or
in what way&mdash;had suddenly lost their
supernatural character to Caius Bononius.
So he thought that by the exercise of a little
theatrical talent he could turn the conditions
imposed to his own advantage. To leave
the seven-hilled city did not seem too painful
a sacrifice, for he had long been considering
whether it might not be time to
collect his riches and, by retiring to the
seclusion of private life, escape the danger
constantly threatening him from the ancient
imperial edicts. Only he needed to remain
unmolested until he could accomplish at his
leisure this gathering of his means, especially
the conversion into money of his considerable
landed property, his estates and
country houses. So he did not reflect long.</p>

<p>“I’ll confess everything,” he said with a
half sarcastic smile, “if you’ll all swear to<span class="pagenum">[93]</span>
keep my acknowledgment secret for six
months. You may disclose it only to Lucius
Rutilius and Heliodorus’s daughter, on
condition that they, too, will promise to
maintain silence. I will quit the seven-hilled
city, too, as the centurion commands;
but I beg as a favor an additional delay of
a few months. If you refuse”&mdash;here his
voice suddenly grew grave and threatening,
like the roll of distant thunder,&mdash;“by all the
horrors of death&mdash;I would rather give my
neck to the lictor’s axe.”</p>

<p>“Grant it to him!” said Bononius, who
was burning with impatience.</p>

<p>Philippus consented and, with the young
sage and Lydia, took a solemn oath. Then
Bononius told the Chaldean, who could
only move with difficulty, to sit down on a
cushioned couch and answer his questioner
with strict conformity to the truth. He
himself stood with folded arms directly in
front of the couch. Philippus, sword in<span class="pagenum">[94]</span>
hand, stationed himself by the magician’s
side, while Lydia leaned in breathless expectation
over the back of a bronze arm-chair.</p>

<p>“First of all,” Caius Bononius began,
“tell us one thing: do you believe in the
existence of a power in the Nether World,
a creature which has some traits akin to the
terrible being in whom people believe under
the name of Hecate? An answer to this
question seems to me valuable, because I
should like to know whether you have dared
to offend, by the deception of your juggling
arts, a divinity in whose power you trusted.”</p>

<p>Olbasanus smiled. Now that he had
once yielded, he seemed to take the whole
matter very quietly and after the fashion of
a man of the world, like the Epicurean, who,
reclining on the dining-couch in the brilliantly-lighted
triclinium, chats about death.</p>

<p>“Sir,” he said with aristocratic calmness,
“I believe, if not in Hecate, in the existence<span class="pagenum">[95]</span>
of the mighty void she fills. I, who know
mankind as a gardener does flowers, assure
you: certain things must be systematically
devised by us more talented men, if the imagination
of the people is not to exhaust
itself. Meantime, you might have the kindness
to loose my bonds. Our sworn agreement,
your superior numbers, and this
centurion’s sword make the favor appear
trivial, and it is more agreeable to philosophize
if one is not enduring physical discomfort.”</p>

<p>Caius Bononius made no delay in granting
this request.</p>

<p>“Very well,” he began again when he
had freed the magician from his ropes, “so
you entirely deny the existence of supernatural
beings?”</p>

<p>“I deny nothing&mdash;assert nothing. This
world is so mysterious, the nature of things
is so unfathomable to our intellectual powers,
that it would be madness to form a positive<span class="pagenum">[96]</span>
opinion about the possibility or impossibility
of a thing which does not come directly
within our own experience.”</p>

<p>“I won’t dispute that. Now for details!”</p>

<p>“You need only question.”</p>

<p>“What induced you to send that first
message to Heliodorus’ daughter? Who
bought you?”</p>

<p>“Bought?” repeated the Oriental. “That
sounds so unpleasant, Caius Bononius. Prophesying
was my ordinary business. Like
every one else who practises a profession, I
was at the disposal of any one who paid for
my art.”</p>

<p>“Then, who paid you?”</p>

<p>“Agathon, Philemon’s son.”</p>

<p>“But you have no scruples about ruthlessly
destroying the happiness of two
human beings for glittering gold?”</p>

<p>Olbasanus shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[97]</span></p>

<p>“If Hero believed it was thus appointed
by fate, the fact was a potent consolation
for all the grief of renunciation.
Besides&mdash;do you know whether this union
<em>was</em> for their happiness? My oracle interposed,
separated two persons who wished to
be united: well, this was really the will of
fate; for everything that happens is absolutely
necessary, and events are strung on
the infrangible threads of chance. If you
tell me that my prophecy would have destroyed
their happiness, I shall answer with
equal confidence: it would have saved them
from misery.”</p>

<p>“Admirable logic, by Hercules!” replied
Bononius. “But we won’t argue about the
matter! So Agathon bought&mdash;or paid
you. Did he tell you his reasons?”</p>

<p>“I did not ask him; but as I knew the
man, I guessed them. I knew that Agathon
had been on the verge of ruin for several
months, and having learned that Hero is<span class="pagenum">[98]</span>
one of the richest heiresses in the seven-hilled
city....”</p>

<p>“How did you learn that?”</p>

<p>“Was I to remain ignorant of what hundreds
know? I don’t keep paid informers
in all the fourteen districts for nothing....”</p>

<p>“Very well. So you complied with his
request, wrote to Hero, and sent her the
mysterious page, which so strangely covered
itself with black writing. How is this explained?”</p>

<p>“The mysterious writing can be explained
simply enough,” replied Olbasanus.
“I prepare from milk, salt water, and a third
ingredient, whose combination I invented
with great difficulty, a colorless ink which
turns black as soon as it is warmed. The
page from the book of the god Amun was of
course previously written; the heat of the
fire produced the miracle that drove the
poor, foolish girl to despair.”</p>

<p>“Confoundedly simple, to be sure!” said<span class="pagenum">[99]</span>
the mortified Bononius. “Name the third
ingredient.”</p>

<p>“How can I designate a nameless thing?
It is known only to me; but to explain its
preparation....”</p>

<p>“You are right. There are more important
things in store for us. First: how
could you know that the youth who accompanied
me, and whom I only encountered
by accident, was Lucius Rutilius? He assures
me that he never met you. Did you
recognize him?”</p>

<p>“No. But I was daily expecting a visit
from him. Besides, Agathon knew him,
and Agathon met you as he left my door.
While my servant was leading you by a
roundabout way to the hall of conjuration,
Agathon hurriedly returned and informed
me of Rutilius’s immediate arrival.”</p>

<p>“Yet the servant could not possibly
foresee that it would be for your interest to<span class="pagenum">[100]</span>
delay our arrival. So why did he choose
that way?”</p>

<p>“It is the rule. All strangers pass
through those corridors; only those who
come on errands, like Agathon, are conducted
directly to my rooms.”</p>

<p>“I understand,” said Bononius. “But
suppose&mdash;we had <em>not</em> met Agathon?”</p>

<p>“Then it would undoubtedly have cost
me more trouble to ascertain the personality
of your companion&mdash;and I should have
performed other miracles.”</p>

<p>“How did it happen that the candelabra
around were lighted when you raised your
wand?”</p>

<p>“Their stands are hollow. The lamps
are already burning very low within the
columns. A thick wire screen shuts off the
reflection they would otherwise cast on the
ceiling. When I raise the wand, my assistant
behind the curtains turns an iron wheel
which moves machinery that pushes the<span class="pagenum">[101]</span>
lamps up from the floor, opens the screens,
and turns up the wicks.”</p>

<p>“Go on!” said Bononius. “The metallic
sound your wand drew from the altar...?”</p>

<p>“Was produced by a copper basin concealed
inside. A boy sits in front of it with
an iron rod.”</p>

<p>“I supposed it was something of the
kind. But now: the sudden fall of the victim!
Does the hidden boy have a hand in
the game here, too?”</p>

<p>“Here, too!” replied the magician. “In
the side of the altar is a small movable
plate, which is covered with a thin layer of
common salt. As soon as the animal finds
its head near this plate, it begins, according
to natural instinct, to lick it. When I give
the sign, the boy, with a sudden push, drives
the plate into an opening of the same size
made in the marble, the space it formerly
occupied being filled with a second plate,<span class="pagenum">[102]</span>
also covered with salt, which, however, is
mixed with a poison whose action is instantaneous.
The results you have seen.”</p>

<p>“But suppose the lamb doesn’t accommodate
you?” said the centurion. “Suppose
it should be tired, or satiated, or obstinate?”</p>

<p>“That is provided for. The animal is
deprived a long time of its favorite dainty.
At the worst I incurred no risk. If the trick
failed, it remained a secret; the animal could
then be killed as every priest slays his
victim.”</p>

<p>“You took out the heart and liver,”
Bononius continued, “I watched you with
the utmost care. You held the wand in your
right hand all the time that the entrails were
in your left; so the writing that so completely
robbed Rutilius of his self-command
could not have come from the staff. Far less
could the animal have had a liver ready
inscribed in its body. How did this incredible
thing occur?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[103]</span></p>

<p>“It was not done with the right hand
which carried the wand,” replied Olbasanus
smiling, “but with the left, in which I held
the liver.”</p>

<p>“Impossible!”</p>

<p>“Understand me correctly. Before you
entered the hall the word ΘΑΝΑΤΟΣ was
written in inverted characters on the
palm of my left hand with a black fluid
specially prepared for the purpose. The
moist liver eagerly absorbed this fluid and
when I laid it on the plate, the miracle was
accomplished.”</p>

<p>A long pause ensued. The ridiculous
simplicity of this apparently incomprehensible
marvel, and the bold assurance displayed
by the Chaldean produced a startling effect.
Even Lydia now felt ashamed of having so
long shared poor Hero’s terror and of only
having given her consent after much fear
and hesitation to the plan which was to unmask
the magician.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[104]</span></p>

<p>“A masterpiece certainly!” said Bononius
almost furiously. “It ought not to surprise
me now if I should learn that your
talking skull was a vision of mist or smoke!
To be sure, things are not simple until they
are understood. But we’ll keep to the regular
order of events! I don’t ask about the
peals of thunder and flashes of lightning;
such things may be heard and seen, though
far more imperfectly, even at the performances
of foolish pantomimes. But how do
you explain the ghostly motion that arose
in the brazier of coals? It was an amazing
phenomenon.”</p>

<p>“In the bottom of the brazier was a
sheet of alum, which, melting and bubbling
from the heat, imparted its own movements
to the coals.”</p>

<p>“Now for the skull. Its speech was deceptive&mdash;as
distinct as your own voice is
now.”</p>

<p>“It was the voice of an assistant. A<span class="pagenum">[105]</span>
tube led from the floor into the skull. The
assistant spoke into it below, so the words
seemed to proceed directly from the skull.”</p>

<p>“And its disappearance?”</p>

<p>“Was caused by melting. The skull was
modelled of wax and the plates of the
niche were heated from below.”</p>

<p>“But it was not seen....”</p>

<p>“You saw nothing distinctly,” interrupted
Olbasanus. “Unperceived by you, a
curtain of thin Coan gauze shut off the
niche, thus rendering the illusion less difficult.
A similar effect was afterwards produced
outside in the grounds by the interlaced
network of the branches behind which
the fire-showering Hecate passed across the
sky.”</p>

<p>“Explain this flaming Hecate!”</p>

<p>The Chaldean laughed heartily, then
said in a tone of strange sarcasm:</p>

<p>“Pardon me; but it is a singular fatality
that my most effective masterpiece always<span class="pagenum">[106]</span>
arouses my laughter. I have seen hundreds
of credulous folk prostrate themselves on the
circle of turf in my grounds and, covering
their faces, moan and groan aloud as the
horrible phenomenon rose in the dark sky.
And yet&mdash;or perhaps it is for that very
reason&mdash;the contrast is too sharp. This
Hecate, who apparently passes with frantic
haste across the firmament, is nothing but a
poor kite wrapped in blazing tow. One of
my assistants looses the unfortunate creature,&mdash;which
is prevented from screaming
by a tightly-drawn leather strap,&mdash;through
a huge pipe, twenty ells long. The tortured
bird thus keeps the direction it has taken.
Before the tow goes out, the kite has
reached the place where it ceases to be visible.
Deceived by the branches of the
numerous trees, the awed beholders imagine
the fiery image is far away in the realms of
air and attribute to it gigantic size and
supernatural speed&mdash;just as the eye, when<span class="pagenum">[107]</span>
gazing into vacancy, mistakes a fly buzzing
close by for the dimly-seen shadow of a
huge bird. This, oh! Bononius, is Hecate,
the Ruler of us all, the Princess of Darkness,
the horrible tyrant of the Nether
World.”</p>

<p>“Enough,” said Caius Bononius. “I
now see that we all have some trace of the
mighty demon that is your most powerful
ally&mdash;the fiend called superstition and
human folly. I, too, confess myself guilty,
under the impressions you conjured up before
us, of having been led astray from the
convictions obtained by long years of arduous
labor. I am a human being and may
say with the poet; I consider nothing
strange that is human, not even mortal
weaknesses and errors. But you, Olbasanus,
ought to fear the awakening tortures of
your conscience! Summoned by virtue of
your unmistakable penetration to be a guide
to erring humanity, to lighten the darkness of<span class="pagenum">[108]</span>
its errors, and bring it to the truth, you do
not disdain to profit by its weaknesses, like
the miserable robber who plunders a sick
and defenceless man. Leave us&mdash;or I shall
be seized with loathing and forget my
promise. Other feelings ought to rule my
soul now&mdash;above all, joy at the happy turn
in the fate of your deceived victims.”</p>

<p>“I will go,” replied Olbasanus. “It is
cheap and convenient to accuse me of crime.
But I ask one question, Caius Bononius: how
many of the countless throng that follow
me along the road of error would be my
companions, if I attempted to lead them with
earnestness and zeal into the domain of
truth? One in a thousand! Delusion is
brilliant and magnificent; its sultry breezes
intoxicate; the air on the heights of truth
blows keen and cold, and humanity is a poor,
freezing beggar.”</p>

<p>Caius Bononius unceremoniously turned
his back upon the speaker, and Olbasanus,<span class="pagenum">[109]</span>
holding his head proudly erect, left the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">exedra</i>.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Six weeks later, early in the month of
December, Heliodorus’ house glittered in
the splendor of festal array. Garlands of
leaves and flowers twined around the Corinthian
pillars; countless lamps adorned the
wide halls of the atrium and peristyle. A
select company attired in fashionable costume,
ladies in gaily-flowered pallas, with
glittering diadems and gold pins among
their curls, senators in purple-bordered holiday
robes, rich merchants in Tyrian syntheses,
and laurel-crowned poets, thronged
the gleaming colonnades. Heliodorus was
celebrating the marriage of his daughter
Hero to Lucius Rutilius. The worthy Bononius,
who had not shrunk from taking the
long journey to distant Massilia to bring
his friend back to the scene of his newly-restored<span class="pagenum">[110]</span>
happiness, was treated by the
bride with almost greater attention than she
bestowed upon the bridegroom&mdash;an incomprehensible
enigma&mdash;and Lucius Rutilius,
far from being seized with jealousy at this
apparent neglect, also strove to show the
young philosopher every token of the most
cordial affection. Caius Bononius was evidently
absent-minded. His heart had for
some time been divided between satisfaction
at the successful breaking of the spell which
had weighed upon Hero and Rutilius, and
another feeling that had ripened during the
few days of his intercourse with Lydia.
How it happened was doubtless known to
Eros, the sole enchanter in whose omnipotence
the sceptical Bononius found himself
henceforth compelled to believe. In short,
the young man desired nothing better than
to gaze into Lydia’s deep, dark eyes, listen
to her voice, or brush against her flowing
stola while walking through the colonnades<span class="pagenum">[111]</span>
of the peristyle. Considering his past, it
was extremely unphilosophical&mdash;but the fact
could not be denied.</p>

<p>Rutilius’ wedding afforded him ample
opportunity to satisfy his longing in this
respect. Lydia, too, who had at first been
merely an admirer of his faithful friendship
and untiring energy, gradually passed into
another mood. After Hero’s departure from
her father’s house the young girl felt
strangely lonesome.... When she fancied that
it would be very delightful if she, too, like
Heliodorus’ daughter, could have a home of
her own where she might rule as the wife of
a handsome, wise, talented man, this imaginary
husband unconsciously assumed the
features of Caius Bononius.... So it was
not one of the greatest marvels that Eros
ever accomplished when, the following April,
Bononius and Lydia were married.</p>

<p>Previous to this event, however, the aristocrats
of the seven-hilled city were startled<span class="pagenum">[112]</span>
by two pieces of news which for a long time
formed the topic of daily conversation. One
was the sudden disappearance of the Chaldean
magician, who had sold all his estates,
as well as the palace furnished with Oriental
splendor on the Quirinal, and left Rome
without bidding any one farewell; the other
was the suicide of Agathon, who had
opened his veins in the warm bath of his
own house, which had been mortgaged far
beyond its value.</p>

<p><span class="bauthor">THE WILL.</span>&mdash;A <span class="smcap">NOVEL</span>, by <span class="bauthor">Ernst Eckstein</span>, from the
German by Clara Bell, in two vols. Paper, $1.00 Cloth, $1.75
per set.</p>

<p>“Since the appearance of ‘Debit and Credit’ we have not
seen a German novel that can rank, in the line struck out by that
famous work, with ‘The Will,’ by Ernst Eckstein. It is a vivid
picture of German city life, and the characters, whether quaint,
commonplace, tragical, or a mixture of all three, are admirably
drawn. All the German carefulness is in Eckstein’s work, but
there is besides a sparkle and <em>verve</em> entirely French&mdash;and French
of the best kind.”&mdash;<cite>Catholic Mirror, Baltimore.</cite></p>

<p>“The chief value of the book is in its well-drawn and strong
pictures of life in both German cities and villages, and Clara Bell,
has, as usual, proved herself a mistress of the German Tongue.”&mdash;<cite>Sunday
Star, Providence.</cite></p>

<p>“Ernst Eckstein, hitherto known as a writer of classical
romance, now tries his hand upon a <em>genre</em> story of German
life. To our mind, it is his most successful work.”&mdash;<cite>Bulletin,
San Francisco, Cal.</cite></p>

<p>“The present work is entitled ‘The Will,’ and is written by
Ernst Eckstein, the author of the striking historical novel, Quintus
Claudius. The name of Clara Bell as the translator from the
German is assurance enough of the excellence of its rendering
into English. The plot of the story is not a novel one, but it is
skillfully executed, and the whole tale is developed with much
dramatic power.”&mdash;<cite>Boston Zion’s Herald.</cite></p>

<p>“‘The Will,’ by Eckstein, is the latest and best work of
its author. The scene, the people, the events of the story are
new, the plot is ingenious, and the action rapid and exciting
enough to please the most jaded novel reader. The character of
schoolmaster Heinzius would alone make the reputation of a new
writer, and there are other sketches from life none the less
masterly. Ernst Eckstein excels in heroines, of whom there are
several in the book&mdash;all clearly defined&mdash;contending for the
sympathy of the reader.”&mdash;<cite>The Journal of Commerce, New York.</cite></p>

<p><span class="bauthor">PRUSIAS.</span>&mdash;A Romance of Ancient Rome under the Republic,
by <span class="bauthor">Ernst Eckstein</span>, from the German by Clara Bell.
Authorized edition. In two vols. Paper, $1.00. Cloth, $1.75.</p>

<p>“The date of ‘Prusias’ is the latter half of the first century
B. C. Rome is waging her tedious war with Mithridates. There
are also risings in Spain, and the home army is badly depleted.
Prusias comes to Capua as a learned Armenian, the tutor of a
noble pupil in one of the aristocratic households. Each member
of this circle is distinct. Some of the most splendid traits of
human nature develop among these grand statesmen and their
dignified wives, mothers, and daughters. The ideal Roman maiden
is Psyche; but she has a trace of Greek blood and of the native
gentleness. Of a more interesting type is Fannia, who might,
minus her slaves and stola, pass for a modern and saucy New York
beauty. Her wit, spirit, selfishness, and impulsive magnanimity
might easily have been a nineteenth-century evolution. In the
family to which Prusias comes are two sons, one of military leanings,
the other a student. Into the ear of the latter Prusias whispers
the real purpose of his coming to Italy. He is an Armenian
and in league with Mithridates for the reduction of Roman rule.
The unity which the Senate has tried to extend to the freshly-conquered
provinces of Italy is a thing of slow growth. Prusias by
his strategy and helped by Mithridates’s gold, hopes to organize
slaves and disaffected provincials into a force which will oblige
weakened Rome to make terms, one of which shall be complete
emancipation and equality of every man before the law. His harangues
are in lofty strain, and, save that he never takes the coarse,
belligerent tone of our contemporaries, these speeches might have
been made by one of our own Abolitionists. The one point that
Prusias never forgets is personal dignity and a regal consideration
for his friends. But after all, this son of the gods is befooled
by a woman, a sinuous and transcendently ambitious Roman belle,
the second wife of the dull and trustful prefect of Capua; for
this tiny woman had all men in her net whom she found it useful
to have there.</p>

<p>“The daughter of the prefect&mdash;hard, homely-featured, and hating
the supple stepmother with an unspeakable hate, tearing her
beauty at last like a tigress and so causing her death&mdash;is a repulsive
but very strong figure. The two brothers who range themselves
on opposite sides in the servile war make another unforgettable
picture; and the beautiful slave Brenna, who follows her
noble lover into camp, is a spark of light against the lurid background.
The servile movement is combined with the bold plans
of the Thracian Spartacus. He is a good figure and perpetually
surprises us with his keen foresight and disciplinary power.</p>

<p>“The book is stirring, realistic in the even German way, and
full of the fibre and breath of its century.”&mdash;<cite>Boston Ev’g Transcript.</cite></p>

<p><span class="bauthor">QUINTUS CLAUDIUS.</span>&mdash;A Romance of Imperial Rome,
by <span class="bauthor">Ernst Eckstein</span>, from the German by Clara Bell, in
two vols. Paper, $1.00. Cloth, $1. 75.</p>

<p>“We owe to Eckstein the brilliant romance of ‘Quintus
Claudius,’ which Clara Bell has done well to translate for us, for
it is worthy of place beside the Emperor of Ebers and the Aspasia
of Hamerling. It is a story of Rome in the reign of Domitian,
and the most noted characters of the time figure in its pages,
which are a series of picturesque descriptions of Roman life and
manners in the imperial city, and in those luxurious retreats at
Baiae and elsewhere to which the wealthy Romans used to retreat
from the heats of summer. It is full of stirring scenes in the
streets, in the palaces, in the temples, and in the amphitheatre,
and the actors therein represent every phase of Roman character,
from the treacherous and cowardly Domitian and the vile Domitia
down to the secret gatherings of the new sect and their exit from
life in the blood-soaked sands of the arena, where they were torn
in pieces by the beasts of the desert. The life and the manners
of all classes at this period were never painted with a bolder
pencil than by Eckstein in this masterly romance, which displays
as much scholarship as invention.”&mdash;<cite>Mail and Express, N. Y.</cite></p>

<p>“These neat volumes contain a story first published in German.
It is written in that style which Ebers has cultivated so successfully.
The place is Rome; the time, that of Domitian at the end
of the first century. The very careful study of historical data, is
evident from the notes at the foot of nearly every page. The
author attempted the difficult task of presenting in a single story
the whole life of Rome, the intrigues of that day which compassed
the overthrow of Domitian, and the deep fervor and terrible trials
of the Christians in the last of the general persecutions. The
court, the army, the amphitheatre, the catacombs, the evil and
the good of Roman manhood and womanhood&mdash;all are here.
And the work is done with power and success. It is a book for
every Christian and for every student, a book of lasting value,
bringing more than one nation under obligation to its author.”&mdash;<cite>New
Jerusalem Magazine, Boston, Mass.</cite></p>

<p>“<em>A new Romance of Ancient Times!</em> The success of Ernst
Eckstein’s new novel, ‘Quintus Claudius,’ which recently appeared
in Vienna, may fairly be called phenomenal, critics and the
public unite in praising the work.”&mdash;<cite>Grazer Morgenpost.</cite></p>

<p>“‘Quintus Claudius’ is a finished work of art, capable of
bearing any analysis, a literary production teeming with instruction
and interest, full of plastic forms, and rich in the most dramatic
changes of mood.”&mdash;<cite>Pester Lloyd.</cite></p>

<p><span class="bauthor">SERAPIS.</span> A Romance by <span class="bauthor">Georg Ebers</span>, from the German
by Clara Bell. <em>Authorized Edition.</em> In one vol. Paper
cover, 50 cts. Cloth binding, 90 cts.</p>

<p>“A new novel by Ebers is always a pleasure; and ‘Serapis’ has
all the qualities conspicuous in the Egyptian novels that preceded it,
with an intensified dramatic and descriptive power that tempts one to
pronounce it one of the very best of the series. Nothing is lost from
that perfectly preserved atmosphere of something foreign to our own
experience in time and place, which one felt instinctively to be foreign
whether or not one were Egyptologist enough to recognize it as perfect;
while at the same time the interest is kept up by a stress of
human feeling which makes the thrilling events chronicled hold one
as if they happened before one’s eyes. The early Christians are
represented, not as martyrs and haloed heroes, but as human beings
with a great deal of human nature in them; the touch of the Christian
Bishop quite indifferent to the conversion and the fate of a young
Christian maiden as soon as he learned that she preferred to be an
Aryan Christian, being especially&mdash;shall we say natural, or artistic?
The heroine is not a young girl ardent in the Christian faith, as is
customary in similar historical stories, but one clinging fiercely to the
old faiths; the description of the torture to her soul, even after she
began to turn to the light, in the sacrilegious destruction of the old
gods and temples, being given with wonderful vividness. The mere
outward descriptions are singularly effective; whether of a young girl
resting in a garden on soft cushions under the gilt-coffered ceiling of
the arcade, peeling a luscious peach as she listens to the plash of the
fountains and watches the buds swelling on the tall trees, while among
the smooth, shining leaves of the orange and lemon trees gleamed the
swelling fruit,&mdash;or of a maiden devoted to the worship of Isis waiting
for her Christian lover,&mdash;or finally of the magnificent Serapeum,
never more glorious than when the Christians had resolved on its
destruction and the cunning priests, with the aid of mirrors, caused a
ray of the setting sun&mdash;a shaft of intense brightness&mdash;to fall on the lips
of the statue of the god as if in derision of his enemies. Of dramatic
effects there are many intensely dramatic; more especially the scene
where Constantine mounts the ladder with his axe to overthrow the god,
almost as sensitive himself to his own daring as the young agonized
girl, watching him as if the first blow he should deal to the beautiful
and unique work of art might wreck her love for him, as his axe
would wreck the ivory. Even more powerful than this, perhaps, is
the scene where Theophilus, struggling in vain to persuade even his
own followers to the destruction of the great image, seizes the crucifix
of his own Lord, and trembling almost at his own audacity, dashes
it to the ground in fragments, to show that even the symbol of his
own religion is as nothing compared with the spirit; falling then
upon his knees in an ecstasy of remorseful prayer, and gathering up
the bits of broken ivory to kiss them devoutly. The book is so full of
scenes and effects like this, that while quite as instructive in its way
as the other Egyptian novels, it is more strikingly interesting as a
story.”&mdash;<cite>The Critic, N. Y.</cite></p>

<p><span class="bauthor">ASPASIA.</span>&mdash;A Romance, by <span class="bauthor">Robert Hamerling</span>, from
the German by Mary J. Safford, in two vols. Paper, $1.00.
Cloth, $1.75.</p>

<p>“We have read his work conscientiously, and, we confess, with
profit. Never have we had so clear an insight into the manners,
thoughts, and feelings of the ancient Greeks. No study has made
us so familiar with the age of Pericles. We recognize throughout
that the author is master of the period of which he treats. Moreover,
looking back upon the work from the end to the beginning,
we clearly perceive in it a complete unity of purpose not at all
evident during the reading.</p>

<p>“Hamerling’s Aspasia, herself the most beautiful woman in
all Hellas, is the apostle of beauty and of joyousness, the implacable
enemy of all that is stern and harsh in life. Unfortunately,
morality is stern, and had no place among Aspasia’s doctrines.
This ugly fact, Landor has thrust as far into the background as
possible. Hamerling obtrudes it. He does not moralize, he
neither condemns nor praises; but like fate, silent, passionless,
and resistless, he carries the story along, allows the sunshine for
a time to silver the turbid stream, the butterflies and gnats to flutter
above it in rainbow tints, and then remorselessly draws over
the landscape gray twilight. He but follows the course of
history; yet the absolute pitilessness with which he does it is
almost terrible.”&mdash;<cite>Extracts from Review in Yale Literary
Magazine.</cite></p>

<p>“No more beautiful chapter can be found in any book of this
age than that in which Pericles and Aspasia are described as visiting
the poet Sophocles in the garden on the bank of the Cephissus.”&mdash;<cite>Utica
Morning Herald.</cite></p>

<p>“It is one of the great excellencies of this romance, this lofty
song of the genius of the Greeks, that it is composed with perfect
artistic symmetry in the treatment of the different parts, and from
the first word to the last is thoroughly harmonious in tone and
coloring. Therefore, in ‘Aspasia,’ we are given a book, which
could only proceed from the union of an artistic nature and a
thoughtful mind&mdash;a book that does not depict fiery passions in
dramatic conflict, but with dignified composure, leads the conflict
therein described to the final catastrophe.”&mdash;<cite>Allgemeine Zeitung.</cite>

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
